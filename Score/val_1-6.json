All minerals are pure substances.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",

If the balloon pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.\n\nSolid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own.

Then, decide if methane is an elementary substance or a compound.\nIn this model, each ball is labeled with C for carbon or H for hydrogen. So, the model shows you that methane is made of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSubstances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, methane is a compound.\n\nAll substances are made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent chemical bonds. Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.",

Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape.

The rocks can also be squeezed by the weight of rocks around them. Sometimes, the heating and squeezing changes the type of minerals in a rock. These changes form a new type of rock, called a metamorphic rock. The word metamorphic comes from the word metamorphism, which means change.\n\nIgneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.\nSedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.\nMetamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by heating and squeezing. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.",

Minerals have the following properties:\nIt is a solid.\nIt is formed in nature.\nIt is not made by organisms.\nIt is a pure substance.\nIt has a fixed crystal structure.\nIf a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.\nLook closely at the last three properties:\nA mineral is not made by organisms.\nOrganisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.\nA mineral is a pure substance.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.\n\nIn a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution.

So, Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae are in the same genus.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms.

A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.

So, hydrogen sulfide is a compound.\n\nAll substances are made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent chemical bonds.

But it will still have a size and shape of its own.\n\nSolid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape.

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",

    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :Magma is a liquid. A liquid can change shape. But it still takes up the same amount of space.\nMagma is melted rock. Rock is usually a solid. But when it gets hot enough, it can melt! Unlike solid rock, magma can change shape easily and flow.\n\nSolid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas.

The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Ardea cocoi are in the same genus.\nStrix uralensis is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix uralensis and Ardea cocoi are not in the same genus.\nPelecanus occidentalis is in the genus Pelecanus. The first word of its scientific name is Pelecanus. So, Pelecanus occidentalis and Ardea cocoi are not in the same genus.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.

For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the kelp.\nThe only arrow pointing to the black rockfish starts from the zooplankton. The only arrow pointing to the zooplankton starts from the phytoplankton. No arrow points to the phytoplankton. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp to the black rockfish.\nThere are two arrows pointing to the plainfin midshipman. These start from the phytoplankton and the zooplankton. The only arrow pointing to the zooplankton starts from the phytoplankton. No arrow points to the phytoplankton. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp to the plainfin midshipman.\nNo arrow points to the phytoplankton. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp to the phytoplankton.There is one path matter can take from the kelp to the kelp bass: kelp->kelp bass.\n\nA food web is a model.\nA food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.\nArrows show how matter moves.\nA food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.\nAn organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.\nAn organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",

The first word of its scientific name is Polysticta. So, Polysticta stelleri and Larus occidentalis are not in the same genus.\nLarus michahellis is in the genus Larus. The first word of its scientific name is Larus. So, Larus michahellis and Larus occidentalis are in the same genus.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.

A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.\nIf you pour diesel into a different container, the diesel will take the shape of that container.\n\nSolid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape.

    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :An American kestrel's scientific name is Falco sparverius. The first word of its scientific name is Falco.\nArdea cinerea is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea cinerea and Falco sparverius are not in the same genus.\nArdea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Falco sparverius are not in the same genus.\nFalco tinnunculus is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco tinnunculus and Falco sparverius are in the same genus.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",

So, in a food web, secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. Primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.\nThe black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea and the rotifer. The water flea are the rotifer are both primary consumers, so the black crappie is a secondary consumer.\nThe copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a primary consumer, so the copepod is a secondary consumer.\nThe golden algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer.\nThe green algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer.\n\nA food web is a model.\nA food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way.

So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.\nArrows show how matter moves.\nA food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.\nAn organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.\nAn organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKurt was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Kurt wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C.\nFigure: a weather station.",

    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :\n\nPeople can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",

    ],
    "hint": "Read the text about sloths.\nSloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\n\nCameron designed an electric circuit to test how well different types of metal conduct electricity. The circuit included a battery, a light bulb, wires, and clips that could be attached to a sheet of metal. If the metal conducted electricity poorly, the light bulb would appear dim. If the metal conducted electricity well, the light bulb would appear bright.\nCameron collected nine equally sized sheets of metal: three sheets of copper, three sheets of iron, and three sheets of aluminum. He used the clips to attach each metal sheet, one sheet at a time, to the circuit. For each sheet, Cameron used a light meter to measure how much light the bulb produced.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: clips attached to a sheet of copper in a circuit.",
    "answer": 1,
    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :\n\nExperiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.\nThe amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.\nThe number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",

    ],
    "hint": "Read the text about beetles.\nThere are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.\nOne of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.\nBeetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.\nFinally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive.",

To do this, they would need to figure out how many ancient species have gone extinct.\nBased on these clues, you can guess that fossil evidence let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct animals. This helped them figure out that beetles die out less often than other animals, which explains the huge number of beetle species.\n\nInformational texts include many facts, examples, and details.

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration.

    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :\n\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",

Lynx rufus and Macropus rufus have the same species name within their genus, rufus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx, and Macropus rufus is in the genus Macropus.\nMacropus giganteus is in the genus Macropus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus. So, Macropus giganteus and Macropus rufus are in the same genus.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.

Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested.

In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured.

Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others.

There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.\n\nIn a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration.

    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :\n\nExperiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",

So, Chelmon rostratus and Amphiprion frenatus are not in the same species.\nPremnas biaculeatus does not have the same scientific name as a copperband butterflyfish. So, Chelmon rostratus and Premnas biaculeatus are not in the same species.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.

The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Dillon wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind.

    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :\n\nPeople can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",

Minerals have the following properties:\nIt is a solid.\nIt is formed in nature.\nIt is not made by organisms.\nIt is a pure substance.\nIt has a fixed crystal structure.\nIf a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.\nLook closely at the last three properties:\nA mineral is not made by organisms.\nOrganisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.\nA mineral is a pure substance.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.\n\nMagnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",

Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds.

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration.

A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration.

    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :Count the number of chemical elements represented in the model. Then, decide if phosphine is an elementary substance or a compound.\nIn this model, each ball is labeled with P for phosphorus or H for hydrogen. So, the model shows you that phosphine is made of two chemical elements bonded together.\nSubstances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, phosphine is a compound.\n\nAll substances are made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent chemical bonds. Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.",

Inside the nest are sheets of tiny rooms made of wax, called honeycombs. The tiny rooms are shaped like hexagons. That means they have six sides. These hexagons fit together without wasting space, and their shape helps make the nest stronger.\nTo make the wax for the honeycombs, bees use the sugar from the honey they eat. They convert this sugar into wax. To make the honeycomb rooms, bees first make a circle with the soft wax. They then use their bodies to push the circle and give it its six flat sides. Once the rooms have been built, the bees use them to store pollen, eggs, and honey. All of those are things that bees need to keep growing and working day after day.",

There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.\n\nIn a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration.

The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Zach wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C.\nFigure: a weather station.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",

The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",

    "hint": "",
    "answer": 0,
    "solution_lecture": "The solution and lecture are :Iodine is a liquid you can use to clean a cut. If you pour iodine into a different container, it will take the shape of that container. But the iodine will still take up the same amount of space.\n\nSolid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas.

So, Premnas biaculeatus and Diodon hystrix are not in the same species.\nHalichoeres hortulanus does not have the same scientific name as a maroon clownfish. So, Premnas biaculeatus and Halichoeres hortulanus are not in the same species.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.

    "hint": "Read the text about okapis.\nWhen you first see an okapi, you might think it's related to a horse or a zebra. Its body and neck are horse-like, and its legs have black-and-white stripes like a zebra does. But the okapi is not related to a horse or a zebra; its closest relative is actually the giraffe. In fact, okapis are sometimes called forest giraffes, since they live mainly in the rain forests of central Africa.\nAn okapi's relationship to a giraffe is most noticeable in its face. Like giraffes, okapis have long, thin faces topped with large, upward-pointing ears. Male okapis also have little furry horns like giraffes' horns. Additionally, both giraffes and okapis have long, dark tongues, which can grab and strip leaves from trees. And just like giraffes, okapis are plant eaters, feeding on leaves, buds, twigs, and fruit.\nIn many ways, though, okapis are quite different from their giraffe cousins. An okapi's neck is much shorter than a giraffe's. This is useful, because a long neck would make it difficult to move through thick vegetation. Another important difference is that giraffes are social and live in herds, while okapis are shy, solitary creatures. They tend to live alone, hiding in the dense forest. Perhaps that's why most people didn't even know okapis existed until around 1900.\nEven though okapis tend to keep to themselves, they do have ways to communicate with each other. For example, they mark their territories by leaving scent marks with their feet. And mother okapis can communicate with their babies \"silently,\" using sounds that are too low in pitch for people—and predators—to hear. That's a good thing, too, as these animals are in danger of dying out. They need all the protection from predators that they can get.",

So, Pelecanus rufescens and Falco peregrinus are not in the same genus.\nFalco novaeseelandiae is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco novaeseelandiae and Falco peregrinus are in the same genus.\n\nScientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",

A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.\nIf you pour caramel sauce into a container, the caramel sauce will take the shape of that container.

Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others.

But it still takes up the same amount of space.\nIf you crack open an egg and pour it into a pan, the egg white will change shape.\n\nSolid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas.
