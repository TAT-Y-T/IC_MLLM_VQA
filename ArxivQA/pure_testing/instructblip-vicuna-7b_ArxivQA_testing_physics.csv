A. The linear predictor performs better as it results in more closed-loop trajectories.
B. The predictor-corrector is more effective in stabilizing the trajectories.
C. The linear predictor is more computationally efficient.
D. The predictor-corrector causes more oscillations in the trajectories.
Please select the correct answer and explain why. B. The predictor-corrector is more effective in stabilizing the trajectories.","an be inferred about the performance of the policy trained with the augmented data set using only a linear predictor compared to the predictor-corrector?

The right panel's trajectories, which represent the policy trained with the predictor-corrector method, are closer together and follow a similar pattern, suggesting that this method is more effective in stabilizing the trajectories.",0.15320919501913136,0.39175257233287275,0.35
