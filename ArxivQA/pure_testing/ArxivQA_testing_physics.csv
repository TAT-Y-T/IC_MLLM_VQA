Explanation: In the ""active"" state, the presence of \( F_{active} \) causes the liquid droplet to spread out more on the surface, as indicated by the larger contact angle (\( \theta_a \)) compared to the passive state where the contact angle (\( \theta_c \)) is smaller. This suggests that the active force is reducing the contact angle, which leads to increased spreading of the droplet. The figure shows that the droplet in the active state is more spread out along the surface than in the passive state, confirming this effect.","The figure shows that the application of F_active in the active state leads to a decrease in the contact angle (θ_a compared to θ_c) and a visible increase in the spreading of the droplet (the droplet appears flatter), which indicates more wetting of the surface.",0.10725259092043132,0.3749999954882812,0.5555555555555556

The wavy line suggests a direct transition between the two states without involving any intermediate steps that would be represented by a photon exchange.","D. Non-radiative transition
