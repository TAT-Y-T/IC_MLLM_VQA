For instance, -4 (incoming) subtracted from 4 (spider's number) equals 0 (edge number). To find the spider's number, we look at the edge number -24, which is a result of subtracting -48 and -4. So, the spider's number has to be -8 because -48 + 8 = -40 and -40 - 4 = -44 (not -24), but -48 + 4 = -44, and -44 + 4 = -40 which is closer to -24, indicating some consistency error or missing information in the figure.

To convert the linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light.", "D. To detect single photons."], "question": "In the setup shown in figure (b), what is the purpose of the HWP and QWP arrangement?", "label": "C", "rationale": "HWP stands for Half-Wave Plate, and QWP stands for Quarter-Wave Plate. These are used to manipulate the polarization of light. Specifically, a combination of a half-wave plate followed by a quarter-wave plate can be used to convert linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light. They are not used for splitting, focusing light, or detecting photons."}
