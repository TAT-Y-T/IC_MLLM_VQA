No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the lichen to the bilberry.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.2705,0.0299,0.1844,0.3846

Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","ttract or repel each other?
A. repel
B. attract

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","The right answare is A To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0029,0.0011,0.1485,0.1733

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Answer: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.","The right answare is B Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.2194,0.0346,0.2449,0.4211

Answer: The grass is brown and dry. Some of the grass on the ground is burning.","The right answare is B Evidence is information that tells you something happened.
How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.0512,0.0022,0.149,0.1724

So, there are arrows in a food web that point from other organisms to consumers.
The mushroom has arrows pointing to it from the barren-ground caribou and the grizzly bear. So, the mushroom is a consumer.
The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the lichen is a producer, not a consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.","The right answare is C The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.2334,0.0534,0.2594,0.4762

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The water mold does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the water mold is a decomposer.
The bacteria do not have arrows pointing from them to other organisms. So, the bacteria are decomposers.
The green algae has arrows pointing from it. So, the green algae is not a decomposer.
The golden algae has an arrow pointing from it. So, the golden algae is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","ttract or repel each other?
A. repel
B. attract

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","The right answare is A To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0029,0.0011,0.1485,0.1733

So, in this food web, matter does not move from the sea cucumber to the bat star..

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1622,0.0372,0.2286,0.3113

Answer: The beak of the scarlet macaw is adapted to crack open large, hard nuts.","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the scarlet macaw.
The scarlet macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The scarlet macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The African gray parrot has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts.
The white-tipped sicklebill has a long, thin, curved beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The white-tipped sicklebill uses its beak to drink nectar out of long flowers.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0609,0.0246,0.208,0.2329

This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.0665,0.0125,0.1333,0.236

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Sphalerite is a mineral. It is a mineral because it is a solid substance that is not made by living things. It is a mineral because it is a fixed crystal structure.","The right answare is B Sphalerite has all the properties of a mineral. So, sphalerite is a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.0629,0.0187,0.2327,0.2824

Answer: A glass of water is a solid.","glass a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a solid
B. a gas
C. a liquid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A glass of water is a solid.","The right answare is C The water in a glass is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour water from a glass into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0003,0.0,0.1067,0.1146

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.0345,0.0036,0.1545,0.2209

B. a gas
C. a solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A balloon is a solid object.  It is made of rubber.  It is not a liquid.  It is not a gas.","The right answare is C A rubber balloon is a solid. You can bend a balloon. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",0.0072,0.0006,0.1824,0.1383

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3333,0.0342,0.2091,0.3667

Hint: This drawing shows a type of archosaur, a dinosaur that grew to be about six feet long. This archosaur's fossil was discovered in rock near the Ghost Ranch Quarry in New Mexico. It was named after the painter Georgia O'Keeffe because she lived nearby.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A This organism's scientific name refers to Georgia O'Keeffe.
The word okeeffeae refers to Georgia O'Keeffe. So, this archosaur's scientific name is Effigia okeeffeae.

When a scientist identifies a new organism, he or she chooses its scientific name.
Sometimes, an organism is named after the place where it was first found. Other times, an organism is named after the scientist who first identified it. Or, the scientific name might describe the organism's physical traits.
Many of the words that make up scientific names are based on words from old languages, like Latin and classical Greek. Sometimes, English words are changed to make them sound more like Latin or Greek. The new words are then used in an organism's scientific name.",0.1051,0.0082,0.1649,0.3151

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.225,0.1115,0.3322,0.4247

For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.
The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. No arrow points to the lichen. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the barren-ground caribou.
No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the bilberry.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1794,0.0275,0.2353,0.3222

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a pink ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is B Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2868,0.0875,0.2839,0.4158

A. North America
B. Africa
C. South America

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect North America or South America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",0.0,0.0,0.0544,0.1158

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0609,0.0282,0.208,0.2222

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.2736,0.1419,0.3534,0.3455

It has a blue beak.","The right answare is A A blue jay's scientific name is Cyanocitta cristata.
Larus michahellis does not have the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Larus michahellis are not in the same species.
Goura victoria does not have the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Goura victoria are not in the same species.
Cyanocitta cristata has the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1344,0.0273,0.1897,0.275

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

A. a gas
B. a liquid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A coffee mug is a solid.","The right answare is C A coffee mug is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
When you pour coffee into a coffee mug, the mug keeps its shape. If you drop a coffee mug, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles because it has a higher concentration of solution.","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0591,0.028,0.208,0.2329

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The prime meridian intersects the equator at the equator.","The right answare is A The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects the Atlantic Ocean. It does not intersect the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

The saddle-billed stork has a long neck. Its neck is adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still. This allows the saddle-billed stork to grab the prey without scaring it away.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The black-headed heron has a long neck. Its neck is adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still.
The northern pintail has a short neck. Its neck is not adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.

Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.2085,0.004,0.1571,0.2024

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a green ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 5 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2928,0.0885,0.2839,0.4216

Answer:","The right answare is B The equator is the line at 0° latitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Europe or North America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

It is not made by living things because it is not made by living things.","The right answare is A Peridotite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, peridotite is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles because it has a higher concentration of solution.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Diane and Sofia were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test. They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used. Figure: preparing a concrete slump test.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2947,0.1262,0.2591,0.4222

Brennan was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Brennan wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather. So, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind.

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3373,0.142,0.2925,0.4286

Goura cristata is in the genus Goura. The first word of its scientific name is Goura. So, Goura cristata and Strix aluco are not in the same genus.
This organism and the tawny owl are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Strix aluco.
Cyanocitta cristata is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Strix aluco are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2928,0.0885,0.2839,0.4216

This organism and the green tree frog are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Hyla cinerea.
Ardea cinerea and Hyla cinerea are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ardea cinerea and Hyla cinerea have the same species name within their genus, cinerea. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ardea cinerea is in the genus Ardea, and Hyla cinerea is in the genus Hyla.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Hyla cinerea are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3258,0.1359,0.2695,0.4222

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.1646,0.0108,0.135,0.2209

Answer: A. a gas","The right answare is A The bubbles in soda are filled with carbon dioxide gas. Carbon dioxide gas spreads out to fill a space.
Carbon dioxide fills all the space inside the bubbles. If the bubbles pop at the surface of the soda, the carbon dioxide will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.0339,0.0703

She compared the darkness of the linen fabric","The right answare is B Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.2506,0.0059,0.1822,0.2381

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A trombone is a solid","ir moving through a trombone a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a gas
B. a solid
C. a liquid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A trombone is a solid","The right answare is A The air moving through a trombone is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air in a trombone expands to fill all the space inside the trombone. When air leaves the trombone, the air expands to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",0.0005,0.0001,0.1316,0.099

Hint: Leopards are carnivores, or meat eaters. They eat large mammals like deer and antelope. The 's mouth is adapted to tear through meat. Figure: leopard.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The leopard's mouth is adapted to tear through meat.","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the leopard.
The leopard has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The leopard uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The Eurasian lynx has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The aardvark has a long tube-shaped mouth and a few, small teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The aardvark uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.",0.0379,0.0189,0.209,0.2283

So, the mutation in the CLCN1 gene affected the structure and function of the chloride channel protein.

An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.","The right answare is B The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.2334,0.0534,0.2678,0.4634

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The beaver is a North American rodent that lives in the forest. It eats leaves and twigs.","The right answare is A A North American beaver's scientific name is Castor canadensis. The first word of its scientific name is Castor.
This organism and the North American beaver are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Castor canadensis.
Strix varia is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix varia and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus.
Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis have the same species name within their genus, canadensis. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ovis canadensis is in the genus Ovis, and Castor canadensis is in the genus Castor.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A B is the symbol for boron. F is the symbol for fluorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one boron atom and three fluorine atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols B and F. There is one boron atom, so B will not have a subscript. There are three fluorine atoms, so F will have a subscript of 3.
The correct formula is BF3.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.0389,0.0726

Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","ttract or repel each other?
A. repel
B. attract

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","The right answare is B To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0026,0.0002,0.1386,0.1842

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Pyrite is a mineral.","The right answare is B Pyrite has all the properties of a mineral. So, pyrite is a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

Answer: Peter's experiment can best answer the question, ""Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?""","The right answare is A Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.1819,0.0044,0.1786,0.2289

Hint: This organism is a comet moth. Its scientific name is Argema mittrei.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The moth is a moth.","The right answare is B A comet moth's scientific name is Argema mittrei.
Argema mittrei has the same scientific name as a comet moth. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Sphodromantis viridis does not have the same scientific name as a comet moth. So, Argema mittrei and Sphodromantis viridis are not in the same species.
Acanthaster planci does not have the same scientific name as a comet moth. So, Argema mittrei and Acanthaster planci are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a pink ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2868,0.0875,0.2797,0.4141

The food web is a closed system because","The right answare is A Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The zooplankton has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the phytoplankton. So, the zooplankton is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer. The kelp bass also has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton and the plainfin midshipman, which are both consumers. The kelp bass eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.

A food web is a model.
Models can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.
A living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.
A living thing in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the living thing eats more than one other living thing in the food web.",0.2184,0.0578,0.2642,0.3068

B. A plant's fruit makes seeds.

Hint: An adult orange tree can grow seeds.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A plant's flowers make seeds.","The right answare is A Flowers make seeds. After a flower is pollinated, male cells from the pollen combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The fruit can grow around the seeds. But the fruit does not make seeds. Both the fruit and the seeds grow from parts of the flower.

Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",0.0076,0.0005,0.1275,0.1268

Bubo scandiacus is in the genus Bubo. The first word of its scientific name is Bubo. So, Bubo scandiacus and Pelecanus philippensis are not in the same genus.
This organism and the spot-billed pelican are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Pelecanus philippensis.
Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Pelecanus philippensis are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1074,0.0203,0.1828,0.3

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Pentasteria had a long tube-shaped body.","The right answare is C The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.0334,0.0075,0.139,0.2135

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.2687,0.0053,0.1815,0.2651

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

A. The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.
B. The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers.
C. The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice.
D. The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.

Hint: Read the text about cats. Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship. People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another. It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way. Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!

Answer: The picture shows a riverbed that is dry and cracked. The ground is mostly flat.","The right answare is A Evidence is information that tells you something happened.
How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.0383,0.0013,0.1186,0.1512

Answer: The caribou eats the berries, which are eaten by the worms, which are eaten by the earthworm, which is eaten by the bear.","The right answare is B Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the earthworm.
Arrows point from the barren-ground caribou to the grizzly bear and the mushroom. The only arrow pointing from the grizzly bear leads to the mushroom. No arrows point from the mushroom to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the barren-ground caribou to the earthworm.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2868,0.0875,0.2797,0.4141

Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",0.0945,0.0378,0.2661,0.3043

It eats both plants and animals. The fish is an omnivore. It eats both plants and animals. The algae is an omnivore. It eats both plants and animals. The bacteria is an omnivore. It eats both plants and animals.","The right answare is B Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is a producer, not an omnivore.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton, which is a producer. The plainfin midshipman also has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton, which is a consumer. The plainfin midshipman eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.

A food web is a model.
Models can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.
A living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.
A living thing in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the living thing eats more than one other living thing in the food web.",0.1713,0.0426,0.2217,0.3563

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A solid is a substance that is solid at room temperature.","The right answare is C The air inside a basketball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air fills all the space inside the basketball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

A. Solution A
B. Solution B
C. neither; their concentrations are the same

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Europe. It does not intersect North America or Australia.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Answer:","bout the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
A. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
B. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.2167,0.1048,0.3279,0.4189

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Magnets that repel pull together. Magnets that attract pull apart.","The right answare is A Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

The air expands to fill the space around each tree branch.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.

Ardea purpurea is in the same genus as Ardea herodias, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Ardea purpurea and Ardea herodias are different species within the same genus.
Caprimulgus europaeus does not have the same scientific name as a purple heron. So, Ardea purpurea and Caprimulgus europaeus are not in the same species.
Ardea purpurea has the same scientific name as a purple heron. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1305,0.0235,0.1934,0.2625

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a yellow ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2838,0.0873,0.2797,0.4141

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.

Answer: A bowling ball is a solid.","bowling ball a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a liquid
B. a solid
C. a gas

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A bowling ball is a solid.","The right answare is B A bowling ball is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A bowling ball can knock down bowling pins. But after it hits the pins, the bowling ball still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0004,0.0002,0.1168,0.1042

Answer: Curculioides adompha had eight legs.","The right answare is B The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Arctic fox is the primary consumer in this food web.","The right answare is A Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The mushroom has arrows pointing to it from the barren-ground caribou and the grizzly bear. Neither the barren-ground caribou nor the grizzly bear is a producer, so the earthworm is not a primary consumer.
The Arctic fox has an arrow pointing to it from the bilberry. The bilberry is a producer, so the Arctic fox is a primary consumer.
The barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. The lichen is a producer, so the barren-ground caribou is a primary consumer.
The rough-legged hawk has an arrow pointing to it from the parasitic jaeger. The parasitic jaeger is not a producer, so the rough-legged hawk is not a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.0282,0.0051,0.198,0.2842

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Diamond is a mineral.","The right answare is B Diamond has all the properties of a mineral. So, diamond is a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.0117,0.0017,0.1569,0.2588

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The bird's beak is adapted to crack hard seeds.","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the evening grosbeak.
The evening grosbeak has a short, thick beak. Its beak is adapted to crack hard seeds. The evening grosbeak uses its short, thick beak to press down on a seed and crack open its hard shell.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The hawfinch has a short, thick beak. Its beak is adapted to crack hard seeds.
The common swift has a short, thin beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack hard seeds. The common swift uses its beak to eat insects and other small invertebrates.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",0.0589,0.0282,0.214,0.2759

880,When might a giant tortoise sleep for weeks at a time?,when there is not much water | when the tortoise is growing quickly | when it is cold outside,,A,A,"Question:Question: When might a giant tortoise sleep for weeks at a time?
A. when there is not much water
B. when the tortoise is growing quickly
C. when it is cold outside

Hint: Read the text about giant tortoises. The Galápagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean are home to the giant tortoise. These tortoises are massive, weighing nearly five hundred pounds. However, giant tortoises do not use much energy. They often rest for up to sixteen hours a day. And when there is little water, giant tortoises might sleep for weeks at a time. This helps them save energy. Giant tortoises can live up to a year without food or water if they have to! Life has not always been easy for giant tortoises, though. When people first arrived at the Galápagos Islands hundreds of years ago, they took many of the tortoises away. And some people hunted the tortoises for food and oil. Few tortoises are left on the island today. Luckily, many groups of people are now working to keep these giant animals safe. Hopefully, giant tortoises can roam the islands for many years to come.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2937,0.1257,0.2626,0.4222

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1791,0.041,0.2628,0.299

The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is B Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2898,0.0882,0.2839,0.4272

Answer: The river is flowing fast because it is raining. The river is flowing fast because it is raining.","The right answare is B Read the passage carefully.
A boy floated down the Obed River on a raft. It had rained the day before, so the river was flowing fast.
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the rainfall on a specific day in central Tennessee. This passage describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather.

The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures.",0.367,0.2821,0.4248,0.4675

C. a gas

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A solid","solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a solid
B. a liquid
C. a gas

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A solid","The right answare is B Fruit punch is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour fruit punch into a cup, the punch will take the shape of the cup. But the punch will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0,0.0,0.0836,0.0729

Answer:","The right answare is B P is the symbol for phosphorus. Cl is the symbol for chlorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one phosphorus atom and five chlorine atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols P and Cl. There is one phosphorus atom, so P will not have a subscript. There are five chlorine atoms, so Cl will have a subscript of 5.
The correct formula is PCl5.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.0341,0.072

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:A. a liquid","ir inside a bubble a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a liquid
B. a gas
C. a solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:A. a liquid","The right answare is B The air inside a bubble is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air inside a bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0002,0.0,0.1107,0.0909

Ambystoma opacum has the same scientific name as a marbled salamander. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Lissotriton helveticus does not have the same scientific name as a marbled salamander. So, Ambystoma opacum and Lissotriton helveticus are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a purple ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2928,0.0885,0.2839,0.4216

The first word of its scientific name is Lonicera.
Hyacinthus orientalis is in the genus Hyacinthus. The first word of its scientific name is Hyacinthus. So, Hyacinthus orientalis and Lonicera japonica are not in the same genus.
Lonicera maackii is in the genus Lonicera. The first word of its scientific name is Lonicera. So, Lonicera maackii and Lonicera japonica are in the same genus.
Ulex europaeus is in the genus Ulex. The first word of its scientific name is Ulex. So, Ulex europaeus and Lonicera japonica are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1098,0.0178,0.1973,0.3291

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.2618,0.0276,0.2107,0.3846

Answer:","The right answare is A The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or Asia.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the sea cucumber.There is one path matter can take from the kelp to the sea cucumber: kelp->sea urchin->sea otter->orca->sea cucumber. kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp bass to the sea cucumber.. bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bat star to the sea cucumber.. There are two paths matter can take from the phytoplankton to the sea cucumber: phytoplankton->plainfin midshipman->sea cucumber. phytoplankton->zooplankton->plainfin midshipman->sea cucumber.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1658,0.0216,0.2301,0.3077

Answer: The fossil shows a fish with a large red lump on its head.","The right answare is A The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.0594,0.0115,0.1648,0.1932

Answer:","The right answare is A There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

The hair dryer is a device that blows hot air onto a person's hair.  The hot air is heated by a heater","The right answare is A The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

A. to act like kittens
B. to talk to other cats
C. to talk to people

Hint: Read the text about cat meows. While kittens meow to their mothers, they stop once they are old enough to take care of themselves. At that point, cats use smell, touch, and body language to talk to each other. So if adult cats aren't making noise for each other, why do cats meow? Cats meow to talk with their humans! If you are a cat owner, you may be interested in understanding your cat's meows. Different meows can have distinct meanings. A short, high squeak or chirp is a cheerful hello. A louder and longer meow is a cat's way of saying ""Please?"" or ""Let me out!"" An even longer and louder meow is your cat's way of demanding something, like ""Food! Now!"" Of course, the best cat sound to many cat owners is a low, rumbling purr that comes from a happy cat.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A T-shirt is a solid.","The right answare is C A T-shirt is a solid. You can fold a T-shirt. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The beak of the European nightjar is adapted to catch insects.","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the European nightjar.
A short, thin beak is light and easy to move. The European nightjar uses its beak to grab fast-moving insects while flying.

B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of iodine. odine is found in some types of disinfectants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Iodine is an elementary substance.","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether iodine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the ball-and-stick model shown above, both of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that dark purple represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol I. So, the model shows you that a molecule of iodine is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that iodine is composed of only one chemical element. So, iodine is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.",0.0011,0.0005,0.1254,0.1584

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of pink particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

A. They can communicate with many kinds of animals.
B. They can communicate about specific problems.
C. They can understand some human speech.

Hint: Read the text about bats. Several kinds of animals ""talk"" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal ""languages,"" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues. Researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages. What Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another. The researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.

Answer: The owl is a great gray owl.","The right answare is B A great gray owl's scientific name is Strix nebulosa. The first word of its scientific name is Strix.
Cyanocitta stelleri is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta stelleri and Strix nebulosa are not in the same genus.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Strix nebulosa are in the same genus.
Cyanocitta cristata is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Strix nebulosa are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Answer: The katydid eats a primary consumer because it is a primary consumer.","The right answare is C In this food chain, the katydid is a primary consumer because it eats a producer. The producer in this food chain is the slender wheatgrass.

Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer.

B. neither; their concentrations are the same
C. Solution A

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0609,0.0246,0.216,0.2222

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A soccer ball is a solid.","The right answare is B The air inside a soccer ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air fills all the space inside the soccer ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Answer: The magnets will attract each other.","ttract or repel each other?
A. attract
B. repel

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The magnets will attract each other.","The right answare is B To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0029,0.0004,0.1584,0.1842

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The great egret is a large bird that is found in the northern parts of the world.","The right answare is A A great egret's scientific name is Ardea alba. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.
Tyto alba and Ardea alba are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Tyto alba and Ardea alba have the same species name within their genus, alba. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Tyto alba is in the genus Tyto, and Ardea alba is in the genus Ardea.
This organism and the great egret are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Ardea alba.
Diodon nicthemerus is in the genus Diodon. The first word of its scientific name is Diodon. So, Diodon nicthemerus and Ardea alba are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.",0.2736,0.1419,0.3454,0.3455

A. a gas
B. a liquid
C. a solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A. a gas","The right answare is C A stuffed hippo is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
When you hold a stuffed hippo in your hands, the stuffed hippo still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0002,0.0,0.1201,0.1053

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.2688,0.0258,0.1834,0.3111

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is C H is the symbol for hydrogen. S is the symbol for sulfur. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and S. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There is one sulfur atom, so S will not have a subscript.
The correct formula is H2 S.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.034,0.0703

It is a very intelligent bird and can learn to hunt by itself.","The right answare is A A peregrine falcon's scientific name is Falco peregrinus.
Ardea cinerea does not have the same scientific name as a peregrine falcon. So, Falco peregrinus and Ardea cinerea are not in the same species.
Strix uralensis does not have the same scientific name as a peregrine falcon. So, Falco peregrinus and Strix uralensis are not in the same species.
Falco peregrinus has the same scientific name as a peregrine falcon. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

B. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.3173,0.1486,0.3556,0.4545

Aurelia aurita has the same scientific name as a moon jellyfish. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Cyanea capillata does not have the same scientific name as a moon jellyfish. So, Aurelia aurita and Cyanea capillata are not in the same species.
Aequorea victoria does not have the same scientific name as a moon jellyfish. So, Aurelia aurita and Aequorea victoria are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1467,0.0278,0.17,0.2593

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The marmot's mouth is adapted for gnawing.","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the marmot.
The marmot has large front teeth. Its mouth is adapted for gnawing. The large front teeth can help the marmot break off pieces of food that it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The Damara mole rat has large front teeth. Its mouth is adapted for gnawing.
The aardvark has a long tube-shaped mouth and a few, small teeth. Its mouth is not adapted for gnawing. The aardvark uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.",0.0687,0.0235,0.1901,0.2472

If the","The right answare is A People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2958,0.1266,0.2596,0.4222

These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The earthworm does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the earthworm is a decomposer.
The bilberry has arrows pointing from it. So, the bilberry is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

It has a long, thin neck","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the giant pangolin.
The giant pangolin has hard scales on its skin. Its skin is adapted for protection against a predator with sharp teeth. The scales make it difficult for predators to hurt or kill the giant pangolin.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The nine-banded armadillo has hard scales on its skin. Its skin is adapted for protection against a predator with sharp teeth.
The Grant's gazelle has short fur covering its skin. Its skin is not adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm. Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators.",0.3107,0.0984,0.1858,0.4368

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A ballet shoe is a solid.","The right answare is A A ballet shoe is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is C The equator is the line at 0° latitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or Europe.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Answer:","The right answare is C The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Asia or South America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3244,0.1377,0.2766,0.4222

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

Answer: The prime meridian intersects the equator at the equator.","The right answare is A The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects the Atlantic Ocean. It does not intersect the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A An icicle is a solid. An icicle can melt. But when an icicle is frozen, it has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","ttract or repel each other?
A. repel
B. attract

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The magnets will repel each other.","The right answare is A To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0029,0.0011,0.1485,0.1733

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3333,0.1521,0.2766,0.4444

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3384,0.0586,0.235,0.4667

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Answer: The brown trout is a secondary consumer because it eats a secondary consumer.","The right answare is B In this food chain, the brown trout is a secondary consumer because it eats a primary consumer. The primary consumer in this food chain is the midge larva.

Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer.

For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bilberry.
No arrow points to the lichen. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the lichen.
No arrow points to the bear sedge. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the bear sedge.
There are two arrows pointing to the collared lemming. One arrow starts from the bear sedge, and the other arrow starts from the lichen. Neither the bear sedge nor the lichen has an arrow pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the collared lemming.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1387,0.021,0.2165,0.3158

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.2314,0.0056,0.1732,0.2381

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3346,0.1018,0.2323,0.3778

So, the mutation in the KRT13 gene affected the structure and function of the keratin protein.

An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.

Answer: A helium balloon is a gas.","The right answare is A The helium in balloons is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The helium in balloons expands to fill all the space inside the balloons. If a balloon pops, the helium will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",0.0002,0.0,0.1208,0.09

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Answer:A. a gas","hocolate syrup a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a gas
B. a liquid
C. a solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:A. a gas","The right answare is B Chocolate syrup is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0001,0.0,0.1024,0.0833
