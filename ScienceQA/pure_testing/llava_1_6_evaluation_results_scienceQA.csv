Which of these organisms contains matter that was once part of the lichen?,"bilberry
mushroom",1,0,bilberry,A. bilberry,bilberry,"Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the lichen.
No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the lichen to the bilberry.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.0,0.0,0.02173913021975426,0.0
How long does it take to bake lasagna in the oven?,"33 minutes
33 hours",0,0,33 minutes,"The correct answer is A. 33 minutes.

The image shows a lasagna that has been cooked for 33 minutes in the oven. The lasagna is fully cooked and ready to be served. Therefore, it takes approximately 33 minutes to bake lasagna in the oven.","33 minutes.

The image shows a lasagna that has been cooked for 33 minutes in the oven. The lasagna is fully cooked and ready to be served. Therefore, it takes approximately 33 minutes to bake lasagna in the oven.","The better estimate for how long it takes to bake lasagna in the oven is 33 minutes.
33 hours is too slow.

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.

"What do these two changes have in common?
compost rotting
a piece of apple turning brown","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.",3,1,Both are only physical changes.,"B. Both are only physical changes.

The image shows a piece of apple turning brown and compost rotting. Both of these processes involve physical changes, specifically involving the breakdown of organic matter. In the case of the apple, the browning is due to the oxidation of the fruit's natural pigments, which is a physical process. Similarly, composting is a physical process where organic matter is broken down into smaller components through the action of microorganisms, heat, and moisture. Neither process involves a change in the chemical composition of the substances involved.","Both are only physical changes.

Similarly, composting is a physical process where organic matter is broken down into smaller components through the action of microorganisms, heat, and moisture. Neither process involves a change in the chemical composition of the substances involved.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.029412258683252472,0.008896269684008548,0.2617801003645734,0.15789473684210525

"When World War I first started, what did many people believe?","It would be one of the longest wars in history.
The war would be the first of two world wars.
The war would lead to the death of millions of Germans.
The war would be over quickly.",3,3,The war would be over quickly.,"The correct answer is D. Many people believed that the war would be over quickly because they were expecting a short and decisive conflict. This expectation was based on the fact that the war was fought between two major European powers, Germany and France, which had a long history of conflict and had been at odds for many years. Additionally, the war was fought with outdated weapons and tactics, which were not as effective as those used in modern warfare. The image shows a map of Europe during World War I, which highlights the fact that the war was fought between major European powers and was not limited to a few small countries.

mixing sand and water","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.",1,1,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are only physical changes.

The image shows butter melting on a hot day and sand and water being mixed together. Both of these processes involve a change in the physical state of the substances involved, but they do not involve a change in the chemical composition of the substances.

Butter melting is a physical change because it involves a change in the state of the butter from a solid to a liquid, but the chemical composition of the butter remains the same. Similarly, mixing sand and water is also a physical change because it involves a change in the state of the mixture from a solid to a liquid, but the chemical composition of the mixture remains the same.

On the other hand, heating butter or mixing sand and water can cause chemical changes to occur, which would make those processes chemical changes rather than physical changes. Therefore, the correct answer is B.","Both are only physical changes.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0001711203322941292,6.748363875009247e-05,0.22857142560725624,0.16129032258064516

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",2.008621067044758e-05,8.864218684656724e-07,0.0892857113520409,0.022727272727272728

Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.",0.16971426588318297,0.036592080955328184,0.3165467579069407,0.2
Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature

The image shows two jars, one with green balls and the other with blue balls. The mass of each jar is not provided, but we can assume that the mass of each jar is the same.

The average kinetic energy of the particles in sample A is 400 uJ/particle, while the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample B is 500 uJ/particle. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample B is higher than that in sample A.

Regarding the temperature of the samples, the image does not provide any information about the temperature of the samples. Therefore, we cannot determine which sample has the higher temperature.","Regarding the temperature of the samples, the image does not provide any information about the temperature of the samples.

The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.

The image shows a group of horses, including Blossom, with one horse having a black coat and the other having a reddish-brown coat. This indicates that there are two alleles for the coat color gene, with one allele dominant over the other.

Blossom has the genotype ll for the coat color gene, which means she has two copies of the recessive allele l. Since the dominant allele is L, Blossom's phenotype is determined by the recessive allele, resulting in a reddish-brown coat.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. a reddish-brown coat.","a reddish-brown coat.

The image shows a group of horses, including Blossom, with one horse having a black coat and the other having a reddish-brown coat. This indicates that there are two alleles for the coat color gene, with one allele dominant over the other.

Blossom has the genotype ll for the coat color gene, which means she has two copies of the recessive allele l. Since the dominant allele is L, Blossom's phenotype is determined by the recessive allele, resulting in a reddish-brown coat.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. a reddish-brown coat.","Blossom's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Blossom's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Blossom's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Blossom's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.003704078047401769,0.000896309538660772,0.31730768837278106,0.19047619047619047

Many of the words that make up scientific names are based on words from old languages, like Latin and classical Greek. Sometimes, English words are changed to make them sound more like Latin or Greek.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

"Which tense does the sentence use?

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence describes a general truth or fact about the effects of sun exposure on the skin.
2. The use of the present tense suggests that the statement is not limited to a specific time or event, but rather is a general truth that applies at all times.
3. The sentence uses the word ""over time,"" which implies that the effects of sun exposure on the skin are a gradual process that occurs over an extended period of time. The present tense reflects this idea by indicating that the statement is applicable to any point in time.
4. The sentence also uses the word ""will,"" which is a modal verb that indicates possibility or certainty. The use of the present tense with a modal verb suggests that the statement is a fact that is likely to be true, rather than a possibility that may or may not occur.

Therefore, the sentence uses the present tense to convey a general truth about the effects of sun exposure on the skin, which is applicable at any point in time and is likely to be true.",,"The sentence is in future tense.

In the case of baking cookies, the cookies are undergoing a physical change as they expand and become more solid due to the heat from the oven. This is evident from the image of the cookies rising in the oven, which indicates that they are expanding and becoming more solid.

Similarly, in the case of water evaporating from a puddle, the water is undergoing a physical change as it turns from a liquid to a gas. This is evident from the image of the puddle drying up, which shows that the water has evaporated and turned into a gas.

Therefore, both baking cookies and water evaporating from a puddle are physical changes, as they involve the transformation of a substance from one state to another without a change in its chemical composition.",,"Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. Cookies are made from cookie dough. Baking turns the cookie dough into cookies. The cookies are a different type of matter than the dough.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Water evaporating is a physical change. But baking cookies is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. But water evaporating from a puddle is not.
Both are caused by heating.

Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The image shows a piece of pear turning brown, which is a result of a chemical change called oxidation. Oxidation occurs when the pear reacts with oxygen in the air, causing the pear to lose its natural color and develop a brown hue. This is a chemical change because a new substance (brown pear) is formed through a chemical reaction.

Similarly, acid rain is a chemical change that occurs when pollutants in the air react with water and oxygen to form sulfuric acid. This acidic solution can then react with marble, a type of limestone, to form a new substance (sulfates) that can cause the marble to lose its color and become discolored or even eroded over time. This is also a chemical change because a new substance (sulfates) is formed through a chemical reaction.

Therefore, both the browning of the pear and the weathering of the marble are chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

Therefore, both the browning of the pear and the weathering of the marble are chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of a pear turning brown is a chemical change. The substances in the pear react with oxygen in the air and turn into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the pear, the inside will still be white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the pear.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.

The scarlet macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The scarlet macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The African gray parrot has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts.
The white-tipped sicklebill has a long, thin, curved beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The white-tipped sicklebill uses its beak to drink nectar out of long flowers.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",1.4470146742024263e-29,5.215355063391109e-30,0.058252426618908476,0.04081632653061224

This indicates that Solution A has a higher concentration of the green solute particles.",This indicates that Solution A has a higher concentration of the green solute particles.,"In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",3.6848028406498e-06,1.6360905996779605e-06,0.22916666417534726,0.16666666666666666

If you pour water from a glass into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

What is the volume of a mustard bottle?,"9 gallons

The image shows a mustard bottle that is approximately 6 inches tall and has a narrow neck.

In this case, the radius of the bottle is approximately 1 inch (since the neck is narrow), and the height is 6 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get V = π(0.5)^2(6) = 3.14159 × 0.25 × 6 = 3.14159 × 6 = 18.75 cubic inches.

Since there are 16 fluid ounces in a cubic inch, the volume of the mustard bottle is approximately 18.75 fluid ounces. However, since it is a common convention to express volumes in fluid ounces, we can round this value down to 9 fluid ounces. Therefore, the answer is C. 9 fluid ounces.","9 fluid ounces.

How long is a parking space?,"6 meters
6 centimeters",0,0,6 meters,"The correct answer is A. 6 meters.

In the image, there is a parking space marked with a white line on the ground. The line is approximately 6 meters long, which is the better estimate of the length of a parking space. This is because parking spaces are typically designed to accommodate vehicles of different sizes, and a length of 6 meters is sufficient to park most cars. Additionally, parking spaces are often marked with a single line to indicate the maximum length of the space, rather than the exact length of each individual spot.","6 meters.

6 centimeters is too short.

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.",0.22002242588622659,0.04841592468635234,0.28346456209312426,0.2222222222222222
"What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a bike frame

Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.",0,0,Both are chemical changes.,"A. Both are chemical changes.

The image shows rust forming on a bike frame and a penny tarnishing, which are both examples of chemical changes. Rust is a redox reaction between iron and oxygen, while tarnishing is a chemical reaction between a metal and the environment. Both processes involve the formation of new compounds and the release of energy, which are characteristics of chemical changes. In contrast, physical changes do not involve the formation of new compounds or the release of energy, while heating and cooling can cause both physical and chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

In contrast, physical changes do not involve the formation of new compounds or the release of energy, while heating and cooling can cause both physical and chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change. The metal on the bike changes into rust. Metal and rust are different types of matter.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.04732177583325367,0.012359695343338174,0.30487804454193934,0.21153846153846154

Both poles of each magnet line up with both poles of the other magnet. The south pole of each magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.

Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",2.00205395461642e-09,2.1232777512003326e-10,0.1308411199545812,0.07142857142857142

2. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B).
3. Iago has the homozygous genotype bb for the body feather color gene, which means he has two copies of the allele for blue body feathers (b).

Therefore, his phenotype is A. blue body feathers, as he has two copies of the allele for blue body feathers, which is the recessive allele in this case.","Iago's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb. Iago's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for blue body feathers. So, Iago's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers.
To check this answer, consider whether Iago's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Iago's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Iago's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.005923795975849184,0.002614945470198655,0.29951690440290324,0.19696969696969696
"What do these two changes have in common?
milk going sour
baking a loaf of bread","Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.",3,1,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are only physical changes.

Milk going sour and baking a loaf of bread are both physical changes because they involve a change in the state of matter, temperature, or phase of a substance without a change in its chemical composition. In the case of milk going sour, the bacteria present in the milk ferment the lactose, causing the milk to curdle and change in texture and flavor. This process is a physical change because it involves a change in the state of the milk without a change in its chemical composition. Similarly, when flour is mixed with water and heat to make bread, the gluten proteins in the flour undergo a physical change as they stretch and coil, causing the dough to become elastic and rise. This process also involves a change in the state of the dough without a change in its chemical composition.","Both are only physical changes.

This process also involves a change in the state of the dough without a change in its chemical composition.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made from dough. Baking turns the dough into bread. The bread is a different type of matter than the dough.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.16169649648961962,0.032957595776227665,0.3111111063833334,0.26

Which of these continents does the prime meridian intersect?,"North America
Asia
Africa",2,-1,N/A,The prime meridian intersects the continent of Africa.,,"The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect North America or Asia.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

A. The ship that moved 190 kilometers east in 5 hours traveled a distance of 190 / 5 = 38 kilometers per hour. This is the lowest speed among the three ships.

B. The ship that moved 315 kilometers west in 5 hours traveled a distance of 315 / 5 = 63 kilometers per hour. This is higher than the speed of ship A.

C. The ship that moved 325 kilometers south in 5 hours traveled a distance of 325 / 5 = 65 kilometers per hour. This is also higher than the speed of ship A, but not as high as ship B.

When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Compare the motion of three geese. Which goose was moving at the highest speed?,"a goose that moved 905kilometers south in 10hours

To determine the speed of each goose, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

For goose A, the distance is 905 kilometers and the time is 10 hours, so the speed is 90.5 kilometers per hour.

For goose B, the distance is 925 kilometers and the time is 10 hours, so the speed is 92.5 kilometers per hour, which is higher than the speed of goose A.

For goose C, the distance is 920 kilometers and the time is 10 hours, so the speed is 92 kilometers per hour, which is higher than the speed of goose B but not as high as the speed of goose B.

Therefore, the goose that was moving at the highest speed was goose B, which moved 925 kilometers west in 10 hours.","For goose C, the distance is 920 kilometers and the time is 10 hours, so the speed is 92 kilometers per hour, which is higher than the speed of goose B but not as high as the speed of goose B.

The Nile crocodile has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is not adapted to eat plant matter. The Nile crocodile uses its mouth to eat other animals.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.",1.5007857627073948e-41,4.745901290108358e-42,0.03960396000784238,0.041666666666666664
Which closing is correct for a letter?,"See you soon,
Dale
see you soon,
Dale",0,1,"see you soon,
Dale","The correct answer is B. See you soon, Dale.

My reasoning is as follows:

In the image, there is a letter with the phrase ""See you soon, Dale"" written as the closing. This is the correct answer because it is the most complete and grammatically correct closing for a letter. The phrase ""See you soon, Dale"" is a formal and polite way to end a letter, indicating that the writer looks forward to the recipient's next visit or interaction.

Option A, ""See you soon, Dale,"" is also correct, but it is not the most complete version of the closing. The comma after ""soon"" is unnecessary and could be considered a typo.

Option C, ""Best regards,"" is a common closing, but it is less specific and personal than ""See you soon, Dale."" It could be used in any number of contexts and does not convey a particular message of anticipation for the recipient's next visit.

Option D, ""Cheers,"" is a casual and informal closing that is not appropriate for a formal letter. It conveys a sense of camaraderie or friendly banter, which is not appropriate for a letter to a business associate or someone you do not know well.","See you soon, Dale.

Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Which is a run-on sentence?,"We went to Texas we saw an old fort.
A bag of beans.",0,0,We went to Texas we saw an old fort.,"A. We went to Texas we saw an old fort.

Explanation:
The sentence ""We went to Texas we saw an old fort"" is a run-on sentence because it contains two independent clauses joined together without proper punctuation. An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete sentence. In this case, ""We went to Texas"" and ""We saw an old fort"" are both independent clauses.

To correct the sentence, you could use a period to end the first clause and add a conjunction like ""and"" to join the two clauses: ""We went to Texas. We saw an old fort."" This way, the two clauses are connected with the appropriate punctuation and the sentence is no longer a run-on sentence.

Alternatively, you could use a semicolon to separate the two clauses: ""We went to Texas; we saw an old fort."" This is also a correct way to write the sentence, but it is less common in everyday writing.","We went to Texas we saw an old fort.

On the other hand, stretching a rubber band is also a physical change because it involves a change in the shape or form of an object, without a change in its chemical composition.

Both of these changes are examples of physical changes because they involve changes in the physical properties of an object or substance, such as shape, size, or state of matter, without any change in its chemical composition. In contrast, chemical changes involve a change in the chemical composition of an object or substance, resulting in the formation or breakdown of chemical bonds.",,"Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Stretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But stretching a rubber band is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What is the volume of a fish bowl?,"3 liters
3 milliliters",0,-1,N/A,"The volume of a fish bowl can vary depending on its size and shape. However, as a general estimate, a typical fish bowl has a volume of around 1 to 2 liters (32 to 68 ounces).

To determine the volume of a fish bowl, you can measure its dimensions and use the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The formula is V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius of the bowl, and h is the height of the bowl.

In this case, the radius of the fish bowl can be estimated to be around 10 cm (4 inches) and the height can be estimated to be around 20 cm (8 inches). Plugging these values into the formula, we get V = π(0.1 m)^2(0.2 m) = 0.0012 m^3.

However, since the volume of a fish bowl is typically measured in liters, we need to convert the volume from cubic meters to liters. To do this, we divide the volume by 1000, since there are 1000 cubic centimeters in a liter. This gives us a volume of 0.0012 L.

Therefore, the volume of a fish bowl is approximately 1 to 2 liters, or 32 to 68 ounces.",,"The better estimate for the volume of a fish bowl is 3 liters.

The presence of a chemical formula suggests that the compound has a specific structure with a defined arrangement of atoms. Additionally, phosphorus tribromide is used to make certain types of medicine, which further supports the idea that it is a compound with a specific chemical composition.","You can tell whether phosphorus tribromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide, PBr3, contains two atomic symbols: P for phosphorus and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that phosphorus tribromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since phosphorus tribromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphorus tribromide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0027815618126946,0.0002861212359056639,0.25433525656052663,0.14545454545454545

When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

My reasoning is that the bowl of oatmeal with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature. This is because thermal energy is a measure of the energy an object has due to its temperature. If one bowl has more thermal energy than the other, it will have a higher temperature. On the other hand, if one bowl has less thermal energy than the other, it will have a lower temperature. Since the two bowls are identical except for their thermal energies, the bowl with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature.","the bowl of oatmeal with less thermal energy.

Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

"Which tense does the sentence use?

The reason for this is that the sentence describes an action that will happen in the future, but it uses present tense verbs and present tense forms of the verb ""to be"" (e.g. ""I will float""). This is because the present tense is used to describe actions that are scheduled or planned to happen in the future. In this case, the sentence is describing an action that the speaker plans to do in the future, so the present tense is appropriate.

Furthermore, the sentence uses the present continuous tense, which is used to describe actions that are happening at the moment of speaking or will happen in the near future. The present continuous tense is formed by using the present tense form of the verb ""to be"" and adding the present participle form of the main verb (e.g. ""I am swimming"" or ""I will be swimming""). However, the sentence does not describe an action that is happening at the moment of speaking or will happen in the near future, so the present continuous tense is not appropriate.

The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",6.213159586848109e-49,1.9647735760550778e-49,0.0470588230698962,0.05555555555555555

Similarly, the rotting of the sandwich is caused by bacterial decomposition, which involves a chemical reaction between the bacteria and the sandwich's components, producing new substances with different properties.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

Ringo has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fur color gene, which means that he has one allele for dark fur (F) and one allele for light fur (f). Since the allele for dark fur is dominant (F is dominant over f), Ringo will express the dark fur phenotype.

In the image, there are several rock pocket mice, including Ringo, and some of them have dark fur while others have light fur. This indicates that the dominant allele (F) is more common in the population, which is consistent with the fact that Ringo has the F allele.

This indicates that the dominant allele (F) is more common in the population, which is consistent with the fact that Ringo has the F allele. Therefore, we can conclude that Ringo has dark fur as his phenotype for the fur color trait.","You need to determine Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Ringo's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be dark fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.012687518547253902,0.0039390336029310885,0.3271027995838065,0.1875

Hydrogen peroxide is ().","an elementary substance
a compound",1,1,a compound,"B. a compound

Hydrogen peroxide is a compound because it has a chemical formula of H2O2, which indicates that it is composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. This structure gives hydrogen peroxide its ability to react with other substances and to be used as an antiseptic. The presence of the double bond between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms also contributes to its chemical reactivity.","a compound

Hydrogen peroxide is a compound because it has a chemical formula of H2O2, which indicates that it is composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. This structure gives hydrogen peroxide its ability to react with other substances and to be used as an antiseptic. The presence of the double bond between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms also contributes to its chemical reactivity.","You can tell whether hydrogen peroxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2 O2. This formula contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen peroxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, hydrogen peroxide is a compound.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.0044472176981521705,0.000394744538662151,0.2820512779462525,0.17391304347826086

The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. One of the key protections provided by the Fifth Amendment is the right to remain silent, which means that anyone accused of a crime has the right to remain silent and not answer questions from law enforcement or prosecutors. This protection is important because it helps to prevent people from being wrongly accused or forced to incriminate themselves.

The Fifth Amendment also states that no person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. This means that a person cannot be tried again for the same crime they have already been convicted of. This protection is important because it helps to ensure that people are not unfairly punished for the same offense multiple times.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.

When frightened, the spectacled cobra can spread out its hood to appear larger and more dangerous. If a predator is nearby, the hood can help scare it away.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The bearded dragon has spiny scales around its neck. It uses its neck to appear larger and more dangerous to a predator.
The green anole has a short neck. Its neck is not adapted to help it appear larger and more dangerous to a predator.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large frilled neck might help an animal appear dangerous to its predators.

The commonality between baking an apple pie and plants making food from sunlight, air, and water is that both processes involve chemical changes. In the case of baking an apple pie, the chemical change occurs when the ingredients, such as flour, sugar, and apples, react with heat to produce new compounds with different properties, resulting in the final product. Similarly, plants undergo chemical reactions when they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Both processes involve the transformation of energy and matter, resulting in new and distinct substances.","Both are chemical changes.

Similarly, plants undergo chemical reactions when they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Both processes involve the transformation of energy and matter, resulting in new and distinct substances.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown.
Plants making food is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But plants making food is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

If you hit a baseball with a bat, the baseball will still have a size and shape of its own.
The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.
The water in a waterfall is a liquid. A liquid can change shape. But it still takes up the same amount of space. As water flows down a waterfall, the water changes shape.
A chair is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you sit on a chair, it keeps its shape.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

My reasoning is as follows: since the mom and dad are pushing the strollers at the same speed, the force they are exerting on the strollers is equal. However, the weight of the kids in the strollers is not equal, so the force being exerted on the stroller with the heavier kid must be larger.

It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.

Therefore, based on the image and the given characteristics, it can be concluded that the mineral is pyrite (FeS2).","Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for pyrite contains two symbols: Fe for iron and S for sulfur. So, pyrite is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, pyrite is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for chloromethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Cl for chlorine. So, chloromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, chloromethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for nickel contains one symbol: Ni. So, nickel is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, nickel is an elementary substance.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.002784774882338722,9.000266513011064e-05,0.15204677969289707,0.02

Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",0.18076196083339785,0.025480570607596138,0.23841059110565332,0.08823529411764706

To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

In the case of tearing a piece of paper, the paper's fibers are physically broken, resulting in a change in its shape and size. Similarly, when stapling an envelope shut, the metal staple physically pierces the paper, creating a new bond between the two sheets of paper without a chemical reaction taking place. These changes can be observed and measured, but they do not involve a change in the composition of the materials involved.","Both are only physical changes.

Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces. But each piece is still made of paper.
Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope and the staple get new shapes. Both are still made of the same type of matter.

Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.

A skull is not a pure substance. It is formed in nature.",2,2,A skull is not a pure substance. It is formed in nature.,"The correct answer is C. A skull is not a pure substance. It is formed in nature.

The image shows a skull, which is a biological structure made up of various minerals and organic compounds. While the skull is a solid object, it is not a pure substance in the sense that it is not a single, uniform material. Instead, it is composed of different minerals and compounds that have come together to form the skull's structure. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A describes quartz, which is a mineral that is formed in nature. Quartz is a pure substance because it is a single, uniform mineral made up of silicon dioxide. It has a consistent chemical composition and physical properties, and it is found in many different environments around the world.

Option B describes hornblende, which is also a mineral that is formed in nature. Hornblende is a solid mineral that is made up of a variety of minerals, including ferromagnesian minerals and amphibole minerals. It has a complex chemical composition and physical properties, and it is found in many different environments around the world. Therefore, option B is not a pure substance.","A skull is not a pure substance. It is formed in nature.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.2303017129284132,0.055811537245127635,0.27586206421121606,0.2127659574468085

The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",2.820770088460135e-53,8.920058235208671e-54,0.0470588230698962,0.05555555555555555

Sage's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Sage's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait.

When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.

The image shows a group of sheep, and Moxie is one of them. Moxie has the homozygous genotype ll for the wool color gene, which means she has two copies of the allele for white wool (L). The allele for black wool (l) is recessive to the allele for white wool (L), which means that if an individual has two copies of the allele for black wool, their wool will be black. However, if an individual has two copies of the allele for white wool, their wool will be white, regardless of their genotype. Therefore, since Moxie has the genotype ll and is homozygous for the allele for white wool, her phenotype will be white wool.","white wool.

Therefore, since Moxie has the genotype ll and is homozygous for the allele for white wool, her phenotype will be white wool.","Moxie's genotype for the wool color gene is ll. Moxie's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for black wool. So, Moxie's phenotype for the wool color trait must be black wool.
To check this answer, consider whether Moxie's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for black wool (l) is recessive to the allele for white wool (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Moxie's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Moxie's phenotype for the wool color trait must be black wool.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",1.8817898721750757e-08,2.075176369366787e-09,0.09090908910909093,0.0
"What do these two changes have in common?
a piece of pizza rotting in a trashcan
cooking an egg","Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.",0,0,Both are chemical changes.,"A. Both are chemical changes.

The commonality between the two changes is that they are both chemical changes. In the image, a piece of pizza is rotting in a trashcan, which is a chemical change because the bacteria are breaking down the pizza's organic matter, releasing gases and producing new compounds. Similarly, when you cook an egg, the proteins in the egg white and yolk undergo a chemical change, as they denature and re-form new bonds with other amino acids. This results in the egg white and yolk becoming firm and solid.","Both are chemical changes.

This results in the egg white and yolk becoming firm and solid.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are made of different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But a piece of pizza rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.041208569566874444,0.01125678780524792,0.24852070541367607,0.14

Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!

An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a sentence. In this case, the independent clauses are ""Susan's bedroom is neat"" and ""she puts everything away."" However, the sentence does not use a conjunction or punctuation to connect these two independent clauses, which makes it a run-on sentence.

In the image, we can see that Susan's bedroom is neat, but we cannot determine whether she puts everything away or not. Therefore, the sentence ""A. Susan's bedroom is neat she puts everything away"" is not a complete sentence and cannot be considered as a run-on sentence.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.

The correct formula is H2 O2.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.

A simile is a figure of speech that compares two things directly, using ""like"" or ""as."" In this sentence, the speaker is saying that the little brother is as sweet as pie. This means that the brother's sweetness is comparable to the sweetness of pie.

The sentence uses the word ""as"" to indicate that the brother is sweet in the same way that pie is sweet. This is a simile because it directly compares the brother's sweetness to the sweetness of pie, without using any other words to convey the comparison.

The image of the pie is a common and easily recognizable symbol of sweetness, which makes the simile more effective and memorable. By using a simile, the speaker is able to convey the idea that the brother is very sweet in a concise and vivid way.",,"My little brother is as sweet as pie.
The words brother and pie are compared using the word as. So, the sentence uses a simile.

The air in a trombone expands to fill all the space inside the trombone. When air leaves the trombone, the air expands to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

The sled's mass did not change, so the energy is stored in the form of potential energy.","Think about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Tammy started sledding. As Tammy rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Tammy rode down the hill.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

The leopard has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The leopard uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.

The Eurasian lynx has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The aardvark has a long tube-shaped mouth and a few, small teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The aardvark uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

The plant has the homozygous genotype hh for the stem height gene, which means it has two copies of the allele h. The allele h is recessive to the dominant allele H, so the plant will express the recessive allele and have a short stem. However, since the plant is part of a group of pea plants, it is possible that some individuals in the group have the dominant allele H and will express it, resulting in tall stems. Therefore, the plant's phenotype cannot be determined solely based on its genotype, but it is more likely to have a short stem due to the presence of the recessive allele.","a tall stem.

Therefore, the plant's phenotype cannot be determined solely based on its genotype, but it is more likely to have a short stem due to the presence of the recessive allele.","The pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene is hh. The pea plant's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for a short stem. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0093510746885296,0.00150300545740092,0.3425925884606482,0.23076923076923078

My reasoning is as follows:

Firstly, we can see that the distance traveled by each bicycle is different. Bicycle A traveled 155 miles south, bicycle C traveled 325 miles west, and bicycle B traveled 315 miles north.

Bicycle A took 10 hours to travel 155 miles south, bicycle C took 10 hours to travel 325 miles west, and bicycle B took 10 hours to travel 315 miles north.

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together.",5.613887241577545e-05,3.1230140419847974e-05,0.23529411493512112,0.15789473684210525

An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change. When the tablet touches water, the type of matter in the tablet changes and carbon dioxide gas is released. This gas makes the water fizz.
Burning food on a stove is a chemical change. When the food burns, the type of matter in it changes. The food turns black and gives off smoke.

Burning is caused by heating. But an antacid tablet reacting with water is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Julia started sledding. As Julia rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.",3,-1,N/A,"The commonality between carving a piece of wood and sewing an apron is that both are physical changes.

In the image, carving a piece of wood is depicted as a physical change because it involves the manipulation of the wood's shape and form through cutting, shaping, and sanding. Similarly, sewing an apron is also a physical change because it involves the manipulation of fabric and thread to create a new shape and form, such as a pocket or a hem.

Both carving and sewing are examples of physical changes because they involve the transformation of a material's shape, form, or structure, but they do not involve a change in the material's chemical composition. In contrast, chemical changes involve a transformation of the material's chemical composition, such as the burning of wood to produce smoke and ash.",,"Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The average particle speed for the green balls is 100000 m/s, and for the blue balls, it is 100000 m/s.

Since both samples have the same number of particles and the same mass, we can compare their average kinetic energies. The average kinetic energy of the particles in sample A is 32 ug \* 100000 m/s = 32000000 Joules. The average kinetic energy of the particles in sample B is 32 ug \* 100000 m/s = 32000000 Joules.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.

Since the dominant allele is E, Dutchess will express the trait associated with the dominant allele, which is straight ears.

In the image, Dutchess has straight ears, which is the phenotype associated with the dominant allele E. Therefore, the answer is B. straight ears.","You need to determine Dutchess's phenotype for the ear type trait. First, consider the alleles in Dutchess's genotype for the ear type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Dutchess's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Dutchess's phenotype for the ear type trait must be curled ears.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0037125171512252635,0.0008770358217415218,0.2758620654070713,0.1791044776119403

Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel

To determine the volume of a fish bowl, you can measure the height, width, and length of the fish bowl using a ruler or measuring tape. Let's assume that the fish bowl is 12 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 6 inches deep.

First, we can calculate the volume of the fish bowl by multiplying the length, width, and depth: 12 x 8 x 6 = 36 cubic inches.

Next, we can convert the cubic inches to cubic feet by dividing the volume in cubic inches by 1728 (since there are 1728 cubic inches in a cubic foot). 36 / 1728 = 0.02 cubic feet.

Finally, we can convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by dividing the volume in cubic feet by 128 (since there are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon). 0.02 / 128 = 0.0008 gallons, or approximately 0.08 fluid ounces.

Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?,Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?,"Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",2.7350488646829952e-09,1.9531433883878074e-10,0.05769230565088765,0.0

Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.",0.16030314419074632,0.03383546975786197,0.28571428128985976,0.25
"Based on this information, what is Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?","white spots

This is because Walker has the homozygous genotype AA for the coat pattern gene, which means she has two copies of the dominant allele A. This genotype will always result in the expression of the dominant trait, in this case, the white spots coat pattern. The presence of the dominant allele A will override the recessive allele a, which would otherwise result in solid coloring. Therefore, Walker's phenotype is characterized by the presence of white spots on her coat.","white spots.

The presence of the dominant allele A will override the recessive allele a, which would otherwise result in solid coloring. Therefore, Walker's phenotype is characterized by the presence of white spots on her coat.","Walker's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Walker's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for solid coloring. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring.
To check this answer, consider whether Walker's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Walker's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0013892739490107683,0.0001590732754354996,0.2885572102947947,0.19696969696969696

When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.

We can do this by calculating the average speed of each bus using the distance it traveled and the time it took to travel that distance.

First, let's look at bus A. It traveled 880 kilometers in 10 hours, so its average speed is 88 kilometers per hour.

Next, let's look at bus B. It traveled 850 kilometers in 10 hours, so its average speed is also 85 kilometers per hour.

Since both buses have the same average speed, we cannot definitively say which bus was moving at a higher speed. However, we can say that both buses are traveling at a similar speed, with a difference of only 30 kilometers per hour.","It traveled 880 kilometers in 10 hours, so its average speed is 88 kilometers per hour.

The scarlet rosemallow plant's observable version of the flower color trait is white flowers. So, the plant's phenotype for the flower color trait is white flowers.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

The fruit can grow around the seeds. But the fruit does not make seeds. Both the fruit and the seeds grow from parts of the flower.

Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",1.3845368482957394e-14,1.6316923237209463e-15,0.07594936590290019,0.06666666666666667

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The grocery store has 200 mangoes for sale.
2. 170 people want to buy one mango each, which is a total of 170 mangoes.
3. Therefore, there are 30 extra mangoes that are not being purchased, which indicates a surplus.

In the image, butter melting on a hot day and cooking an egg are shown. Both of these processes are physical changes because they involve a change in the state of matter of the substances involved. Butter melting is a physical change because it involves a change in the state of the butter from a solid to a liquid. Similarly, cooking an egg is also a physical change because it involves a change in the state of the egg from a solid to a liquid or a change in the texture of the egg.

On the other hand, the process of melting butter on a hot day is a chemical change because it involves a reaction between the butter and the heat. Similarly, cooking an egg involves a chemical change because it involves a reaction between the egg and the heat, causing the egg to change in color, texture, and flavor.

Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.

The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.

They are located in the chest, one on each side of the body, and are responsible for bringing oxygen into the body and removing carbon dioxide. The lungs have a branching network of air sacs called alveoli, which facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. When we breathe in, oxygen enters the alveoli and is transported to the bloodstream, where it is carried to the body's cells for use in metabolism. When we breathe out, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular metabolism, is removed from the body. Therefore, the correct answer is A. lungs.","lungs

Compare the motion of three bicycles. Which bicycle was moving at the highest speed?,"a bicycle that moved 30miles east in 5hours
a bicycle that moved 70miles west in 5hours
a bicycle that moved 35miles east in 5hours",1,0,a bicycle that moved 30miles east in 5hours,"To determine which bicycle was moving at the highest speed, we need to compare the distance traveled by each bicycle and the time it took to travel that distance.

First, let's look at option A. The bicycle moved 30 miles east in 5 hours. We can calculate the average speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took to travel that distance: 30 miles / 5 hours = 6 miles per hour.

Next, let's look at option B. The bicycle moved 70 miles west in 5 hours. We can calculate the average speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took to travel that distance: 70 miles / 5 hours = 14 miles per hour.

Finally, let's look at option C. The bicycle moved 35 miles east in 5 hours. We can calculate the average speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took to travel that distance: 35 miles / 5 hours = 7 miles per hour.

Based on the above calculations, the bicycle that was moving at the highest speed is option B. The bicycle in option B traveled 70 miles in 5 hours, which is a higher distance than the other two bicycles. Additionally, the bicycle in option B traveled in the opposite direction of the other two bicycles, which means it had to cover more distance to reach the same point as the other two bicycles. Therefore, the bicycle in option B was moving at the highest speed.","The bicycle moved 30 miles east in 5 hours.

"Which tense does the sentence use?
The bus will go through the tunnel.","past tense

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence states that the bus will go through the tunnel. This indicates that the action of the bus going through the tunnel will take place in the future.
2. The present tense is used to describe actions that will happen in the future.
3. The present tense is also used to describe actions that are currently happening or will continue to happen in the future.
4. In this case, the sentence does not provide any information about the current or future context of the bus going through the tunnel. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the sentence is describing a future action.
5. The use of the present tense in the sentence is consistent with the definition of the present tense, which is used to describe actions that will happen in the future.

Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is a compound that consists of two atoms of silicon bonded to one atom of oxygen. This can be seen in the chemical formula SiO2, which shows that the oxygen atom is bonded to the silicon atoms in a 1:2 ratio. Silicon dioxide occurs naturally in the mineral quartz, which makes up many of the particles in sand. The presence of oxygen in the formula indicates that it is a compound, rather than an elementary substance.",,"You can tell whether silicon dioxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for silicon dioxide is SiO2. This formula contains two symbols: Si for silicon and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that silicon dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, silicon dioxide is a compound.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethanol contains four symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, F for fluorine, and O for oxygen. So, fluoromethanol is made of four chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethanol is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for helium contains one symbol: He. So, helium is made of one chemical element.

The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.

"Which tense does the sentence use?
Christine chops onions for the tomato sauce.","future tense
present tense
past tense",1,-1,N/A,"The sentence uses the present tense.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence describes an action that is currently happening or has recently happened. The use of the present tense is appropriate for describing actions that are ongoing or have occurred in the past and are relevant to the present moment.
2. The sentence specifically states that Christine is ""chopping onions"" for the tomato sauce. This action is likely to be an ongoing process or something that has recently been completed.
3. The image itself shows a person chopping onions, which supports the idea that the action is happening or has happened in the present tense. The image provides visual evidence of the action taking place, which reinforces the use of the present tense in the sentence.

Therefore, the sentence uses the present tense to describe the action of Christine chopping onions for the tomato sauce.",,"The sentence is in present tense. You can tell because it uses a present-tense verb, chops. The verb ends in -s and tells you about something that is true or happening now.

Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.

Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.

"What do these two changes have in common?
baking an apple pie
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.",3,2,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are only physical changes.

In the image, it is described that baking an apple pie and using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon are both physical changes. Baking an apple pie involves physical changes such as the transformation of ingredients into a new substance with a different texture and appearance, but no chemical reaction occurs. Similarly, using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon also involves physical changes, such as the movement of particles on the surface of the spoon to remove tarnish, but no chemical reaction occurs.

Therefore, the answer that best describes the two changes is option C, which states that both are only physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Baking an apple pie involves physical changes such as the transformation of ingredients into a new substance with a different texture and appearance, but no chemical reaction occurs. Similarly, using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon also involves physical changes, such as the movement of particles on the surface of the spoon to remove tarnish, but no chemical reaction occurs.

Therefore, the answer that best describes the two changes is option C, which states that both are only physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But polish removing tarnish from a silver spoon is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.07038014201431692,0.02134473574147522,0.3052631534620499,0.24561403508771928

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Which is a sentence fragment?,"The next baseball game.

A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence. In the image, B is labeled as a sentence fragment, while A is labeled as a complete sentence.

To further support this, we can analyze the structure of each option. A consists of a subject (""Polly"") and a predicate (""draws an arrow that points up""), which indicates that it expresses a complete thought. In contrast, B consists of a subject (""Polly"") and a predicate (""draws an arrow it points up""), but the phrase ""it points up"" is not followed by a verb, which makes it incomplete.

Additionally, we can look at the context of the image to see if there are any additional clues. If the image were describing a piece of writing, for example, we might expect to see more context around option B to make it a complete sentence.

When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.

The two changes that are described in the image are mixing sand and water and carving a piece of wood. Both of these processes involve a chemical change, specifically a chemical reaction. When sand is mixed with water, the sand particles absorb water molecules and the sand particles become hydrated. This is a chemical change because it involves the rearrangement of atoms in the sand particles. Similarly, when a piece of wood is carved, the wood is subjected to a chemical reaction with the tools used to carve it, such as a knife or a chisel. These tools leave behind marks on the wood, which are the result of a chemical reaction between the tool and the wood. Therefore, both mixing sand and water and carving a piece of wood involve chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

To calculate the average speed of Goose A, we would divide the distance it traveled (190 miles) by the time it took to travel that distance (5 hours). This would give us an average speed of 38 miles per hour.

To calculate the average speed of Goose B, we would divide the distance it traveled (235 miles) by the time it took to travel that distance (5 hours). This would give us an average speed of 47 miles per hour.

Therefore, Goose B was moving at a slightly higher average speed than Goose A.

Therefore, the answer is A. neither; the samples have the same temperature.",neither; the samples have the same temperature.,"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",7.371981908271698e-09,3.913243333339487e-09,0.19607842929642447,0.0625

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

A sentence is a run-on sentence if it contains two or more independent clauses that are not separated by a comma and a coordinating conjunction. In this case, the sentence ""Cleaned the cabin for Mrs. Copeland's family"" is an independent clause because it contains a subject (""Cleaned"") and a verb (""for Mrs. Copeland's family""), and it can be completed with a full stop. However, it is not a run-on sentence because it is separated from the following clause by a comma and a coordinating conjunction (""and"").

On the other hand, the sentence ""Zoe rode downhill on her bicycle she held onto the handles"" is a run-on sentence because it contains two independent clauses that are not separated by a comma and a coordinating conjunction. The first clause ""Zoe rode downhill on her bicycle"" is an independent clause because it contains a subject (""Zoe""), a verb (""rode""), and a preposition (""downhill""), but it is not completed with a full stop. The second clause ""she held onto the handles"" is also an independent clause because it contains a subject (""she""), a verb (""held""), and a preposition (""onto""), but it is not completed with a full stop. These two clauses are not separated by a comma or a coordinating conjunction, so they form a run-on sentence.

In the image, there is a bicycle and a person named Zoe, but there is no information about cleaning a cabin for Mrs. Copeland's family. Therefore, the sentence ""Cleaned the cabin for Mrs. Copeland's family"" is not present in the image.",,"Zoe rode downhill on her bicycle she held onto the handles is a run-on sentence.

"What do these two changes have in common?
baking a loaf of bread
melting glass","Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.",2,0,Both are chemical changes.,"A. Both are chemical changes.

The commonality between baking a loaf of bread and melting glass is that both processes involve chemical changes. In the case of baking bread, the dough undergoes a chemical reaction as the gluten proteins in the flour are elongated and cross-linked, resulting in the formation of gluten strands that trap carbon dioxide gas produced during fermentation, causing the dough to rise. This process is a chemical change because it involves the transformation of the dough's molecular structure.

Similarly, when glass is melted, a chemical change occurs at the molecular level. Glass is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2) molecules, which are strongly linked together. When glass is heated, the silicon dioxide molecules break apart and re-form new bonds with other molecules, resulting in the liquid state. This process is a chemical change because it involves the breaking and re-formation of chemical bonds in the glass molecules.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Both are chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Both are chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread!
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Melting glass is a physical change. But baking bread is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Baking bread is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for water contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, water is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, water is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for zinc contains one symbol: Zn. So, zinc is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, zinc is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for methane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, methane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, methane is a compound, not an elementary substance.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:

circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:

Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures.",1.733141042341547e-58,3.0820090302893703e-59,0.0246913577808261,0.027777777777777776
Is a clock a good or a service?,"a good
a service",0,-1,N/A,"A clock is a good.

The image shows a clock on a table, which is a physical object that can be seen and touched. Goods are tangible items that can be owned and used by individuals, whereas services are intangible and typically provided by someone else. In this case, the clock is a physical object that can be seen and touched, making it a good rather than a service. Additionally, clocks are often considered personal items that can be used for timekeeping and can add a decorative element to a space.",,"To decide whether a clock is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is a clock something you can touch? Yes.
Is a clock a job you might pay someone else to do? No.
So, a clock is a good.

Everything you can buy is either a good or a service.
A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Cotton is made by living things. It is not a pure substance.
Biotite is a solid. It is a pure substance.",1,1,Cotton is made by living things. It is not a pure substance.,"The correct answer is B. Cotton is made by living things. It is not a pure substance.

Cotton is a natural fiber that is produced by the cotton plant, which is a living organism. It is not a mineral, as it is not formed in nature and it is not a solid, like the other options. Aquamarine, on the other hand, is a type of quartz that is formed in nature and is a solid mineral. Biotite is also a solid mineral, but it is a type of mica, which is a group of minerals that have similar chemical and physical properties.","Cotton is made by living things. It is not a pure substance.

Biotite is also a solid mineral, but it is a type of mica, which is a group of minerals that have similar chemical and physical properties.","Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Aquamarine is a mineral.
Biotite is a mineral.
Cotton is made by living things. But minerals are not made by living things.
Cotton is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, cotton is not a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.049066100372831774,0.014255290611731733,0.3050847417089598,0.14583333333333334

a friend who weighs 28 pounds",1,1,a friend who weighs 28 pounds,"Based on the image, it is not possible to determine the exact weight of the friends or the weight of the wagon. However, we can make some assumptions to solve the problem.

Let's assume that the weight of the wagon is 21 pounds and one of the friends weighs 28 pounds. To move the wagon at the same speed each time, Vijay needs to pull with a larger force on the friend who weighs 28 pounds. This is because the weight of the friend and the wagon combined is 21 pounds, and Vijay needs to overcome this weight to move the wagon. Therefore, Vijay needs to pull with a larger force on the friend who weighs 28 pounds to achieve the same speed as before.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. a friend who weighs 28 pounds.",a friend who weighs 28 pounds.,"Look for the friend who is heavier.
A friend who weighs 28 pounds is heavier than a friend who weighs 21 pounds. So, to move the wagon at the same speed each time, Vijay needs to use a larger force to start moving the wagon with a friend who weighs 28 pounds.

A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.

1. The sentence describes a continuous action happening at the moment. The phrase ""creeps along"" implies that the action is ongoing and not completed in the past.
2. The present tense is used to describe actions that are happening now or have a continuous nature. The use of the present tense in this sentence suggests that the action of the tiny creature creeping along the vine is an ongoing action.

The two changes, mixing sand and gravel and crushing a mineral into powder, are both physical changes because they involve a change in the state of matter or a change in the form of a substance without a change in its chemical composition. In the case of mixing sand and gravel, the particles of sand and gravel remain the same, but their relative positions change, resulting in a new mixture. Similarly, when a mineral is crushed into powder, the particles of the mineral change in size, but the chemical composition of the mineral remains the same. These changes can be observed and measured, but they do not involve a change in the atomic or molecular structure of the substances involved.","Both are only physical changes.

These changes can be observed and measured, but they do not involve a change in the atomic or molecular structure of the substances involved.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.13294041001614662,0.02065566395714249,0.31111110643765433,0.25

"Is the wind through a tree a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a solid

a liquid",1,1,a gas,B. a gas,a gas,"Wind through a tree is air that is moving! Air is a gas. The air expands to fill the space around each tree branch.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Compare the motion of two ships. Which ship was moving at a higher speed?,"a ship that moved 60miles in 5hours
a ship that moved 75miles in 5hours",1,-1,N/A,"To compare the motion of the two ships, we need to determine which ship was moving at a higher speed. We can do this by calculating the average speed of each ship over the same time period.

Let's assume that both ships started moving at the same time and have been moving in the same direction. We can calculate the average speed of each ship by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took to travel that distance.

For ship A, the distance traveled is 60 miles, and the time taken is 5 hours. Therefore, the average speed of ship A is 60 miles/5 hours = 12 miles/hour.

For ship B, the distance traveled is 75 miles, and the time taken is 5 hours. Therefore, the average speed of ship B is 75 miles/5 hours = 15 miles/hour.

Therefore, ship B was moving at a higher speed than ship A, as its average speed was 15 miles/hour while ship A's average speed was 12 miles/hour.

To further support this conclusion, we can look at the distance traveled by each ship in a shorter time period. For example, if we compare the distance traveled by ship A in the first hour (60 miles) to the distance traveled by ship B in the first hour (75 miles), we can see that ship B was moving at a faster pace. This suggests that ship B was moving at a higher speed overall.",,"Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One ship moved 75 miles in 5 hours.
The other ship moved 60 miles in 5 hours.
Notice that each ship spent the same amount of time moving. The ship that moved 75 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at a higher speed.

An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.

Since the dominant allele is F, the plant will express the phenotype of red flowers, which is B.","The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.
To check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.004558187847314413,0.0016631421301626175,0.3762376198916773,0.2698412698412698

Therefore, the argument is fallacious because it presents only two options when more are available.","The text argues that Hazel doesn't have school spirit, because she doesn't go to football games. However, there may be a number of reasons why Hazel doesn't go to football games. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against",0.07720129950331113,0.019412605549030154,0.33175355023921294,0.12359550561797752

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration.

In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!",9.650433742465124e-06,1.4886719481658276e-06,0.13675213426839072,0.07692307692307693

A rag doll is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you hold a rag doll in your hands, the rag doll still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.

The image shows a washing machine with a white drum, which is the container that holds the clothes during the washing process. The drum is filled with water, indicating that it is in use. Since the drum is filled with water, it can be inferred that the washing machine is in operation and actively washing clothes.

The volume of the washing machine is determined by the size of the drum. The drum is described as being ""large,"" which suggests that it has a significant amount of volume. However, without more specific information about the dimensions of the drum, it is not possible to provide an exact measurement. Therefore, the best estimate for the volume of the washing machine is 32 gallons.

It is important to note that this is only an estimate, and the actual volume of the washing machine may be different. However, based on the information provided in the image, the answer of 32 gallons is the most reasonable and accurate estimate.","32 gallons.

In the image, cutting a piece of rope and peeling a banana are shown. Both of these actions involve chemical changes. When you cut a piece of rope, you are breaking the chemical bonds between the fibers of the rope. This results in the release of energy in the form of heat and light. Similarly, when you peel a banana, you are separating the layers of the fruit. This process involves the breakdown of the cell walls of the banana, which also releases energy in the form of heat. Therefore, both of these actions involve chemical changes that result in the release of energy.","Both are chemical changes.

Therefore, both of these actions involve chemical changes that result in the release of energy.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Cutting a piece of rope is a physical change. The rope is shorter after you cut it. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut rope.
Peeling a banana is a physical change. The peel is not covering the rest of the fruit anymore. But both the peel and the banana are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

A bowling ball can knock down bowling pins. But after it hits the pins, the bowling ball still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

The image shows a kiddie pool that is filled with water. Since it is a small pool, we can estimate the volume to be around 1,080 milliliters. To arrive at this estimate, we can use the formula for volume, which is volume = length x width x height. However, since the pool is a cylinder, we can simplify the calculation by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is volume = pi x radius^2 x height.

Since the pool is small, we can assume that the radius is equal to the diameter, which is half the length of the pool. Therefore, the radius is 0.54 meters (half the length of 1.08 meters). Using this value, we can calculate the volume as follows:

volume = pi x (0.54)^2 x 0.58 meters
volume = 0.745 x 0.54 x 0.58
volume = 1,080 milliliters

Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for cyclopropane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, cyclopropane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, cyclopropane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for silver contains one symbol: Ag. So, silver is made of one chemical element.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom.

Argon is a chemical element with the symbol Ar and atomic number 18. It is a gas that is used to protect important documents, including the United States Constitution, from decay. The chemical formula for argon is Ar, which indicates that it is a compound. An elementary substance is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler components. Argon, on the other hand, is composed of atoms that are bonded together, making it a compound.","You can tell whether argon is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for argon is Ar. This formula contains one symbol: Ar. So, the formula tells you that argon is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, argon is an elementary substance.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.011787850314117257,0.0032306724893933843,0.2754490972627201,0.22727272727272727

Gypsum is not made by living things. It is formed in nature.",0,0,An antler is not a pure substance. It is a solid.,"The correct answer is A. An antler is not a pure substance. It is a solid.

An antler is a growth on the head of certain animals, such as deer and elk, that is primarily composed of bone tissue. While it may appear similar to a mineral in appearance, it is not a pure substance because it is made up of living cells and tissues. In contrast, minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic substances that have a specific chemical composition and crystal structure.

In the image, we can see a close-up view of an antler, which clearly shows its porous and organic nature. The antler is composed of bone tissue, which is made up of living cells and tissues, and it is not a pure substance like a mineral.","An antler is not a pure substance. It is a solid.

Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Native copper is a mineral.
An antler is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, an antler is not a mineral.
Gypsum is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.09138930095551735,0.02278684099941657,0.25870646300933153,0.14583333333333334

a sailboat that moved 100miles in 10hours",1,0,a sailboat that moved 50miles in 10hours,"To compare the motion of the two sailboats, we need to determine which sailboat moved at a higher speed. We can do this by comparing the distance traveled by each sailboat in a given time period.

In this case, we have the following options:

A. A sailboat that moved 50 miles in 10 hours
B. A sailboat that moved 100 miles in 10 hours

Let's start by looking at option A. The sailboat moved 50 miles in 10 hours, which means it traveled an average of 5 miles per hour.

Now, let's look at option B. The sailboat moved 100 miles in 10 hours, which means it also traveled an average of 10 miles per hour.

To determine which sailboat moved at a higher speed, we need to compare the average speed of the two sailboats. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

For option A, the distance traveled is 50 miles, and the time taken is 10 hours, so the average speed is 5 miles per hour.

For option B, the distance traveled is 100 miles, and the time taken is also 10 hours, so the average speed is 10 miles per hour.

Therefore, we can conclude that option B, the sailboat that moved 100 miles in 10 hours, moved at a higher speed than option A, the sailboat that moved 50 miles in 10 hours.

Our reasoning is based on the fact that option B's average speed is higher than option A's average speed. We can see this by comparing the two distances traveled and dividing them by the corresponding time periods.","A sailboat that moved 50 miles in 10 hours

"Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait?","dull fruit
glossy fruit",0,1,glossy fruit,"Based on the information provided, the plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait is B. glossy fruit.

The image shows a group of cucumber plants, and some of them have glossy fruit while others have dull fruit. This indicates that the fruit sheen trait is polygenic and that the gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles, with the allele for glossy fruit (F) being dominant over the allele for dull fruit (f).

The plant in question has the homozygous genotype FF for the fruit sheen gene, which means it has two copies of the dominant allele F. Therefore, the plant will express the dominant phenotype and have glossy fruit.

The step-by-step logic behind this answer is as follows:

1. The image shows a group of cucumber plants with varying fruit sheen.
2. The fruit sheen trait is polygenic, meaning it is influenced by multiple genes.
3. The gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles, with the allele for glossy fruit (F) being dominant over the allele for dull fruit (f).","glossy fruit.

3. The gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles, with the allele for glossy fruit (F) being dominant over the allele for dull fruit (f).","The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit sheen gene is FF. The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for dull fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.04349102656401867,0.01222052320311815,0.36771300014398045,0.24615384615384617

In the image, a man is getting a haircut, which involves cutting his hair with scissors. Similarly, the log is being cut in half with a saw. Both actions result in a change to the physical form of the object, but they are not chemical changes. Chemical changes involve a change in the composition of matter, while physical changes involve a change in the form or shape of matter. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Both are only physical changes.",Both are only physical changes.,"Step 1: Think about each change.
Getting a haircut is a physical change. Your hair is shorter after a haircut. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log splits into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter.

Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.

Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence refers to an action that is currently happening or will happen in the future.
2. The verb ""will measure"" is in the present tense, which indicates that the action is not completed and will happen at some point in the future.
3. The present tense is used to describe actions that are ongoing or will occur in the future.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring.",0.11826110877793071,0.00555543833712426,0.1475409786186511,0.08695652173913043

Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration.

But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",1.223149371159416e-07,8.919904518190117e-08,0.24719100906956196,0.10714285714285714

The correct formula is PCl5.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.

My reasoning is that Isabelle is deciding between the Photography Club and the Theater Club, and she wants the club she joins to be fun.

When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.

Platinum is a precious metal used to make jewelry, and the chemical formula for platinum is Pt. However, the term ""elementary substance"" refers to a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler components. Since platinum is a compound, it cannot be broken down into simpler components, making it ineligible to be considered an elementary substance.","You can tell whether platinum is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for platinum is Pt. This formula contains one symbol: Pt. So, the formula tells you that platinum is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, platinum is an elementary substance.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom.

Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No

Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. Ace has the genotype Ll for the coat color gene.
2. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).

3. Therefore, Ace will express the dominant allele and have a black coat.
4. The image shows that Ace has a black coat, which confirms the genotype and phenotype information provided.","You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Ace's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.00039952170796187333,0.0002234100177348957,0.2564102530892834,0.125

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.

Cellular respiration is a process that occurs in the cells of living organisms and involves the breakdown of glucose molecules to produce energy in the form of ATP. This process involves a series of chemical reactions that involve the input of energy in the form of ATP and the production of carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. The image shows the chemical equation for cellular respiration, which illustrates that it is a chemical change. The reactants are glucose molecules and oxygen, and the products are carbon dioxide and water, along with ATP. This process is essential for the survival of all living organisms, as it provides the energy needed to power the cell's metabolic processes.",,"Cellular respiration is a chemical change. Cells use oxygen to break down sugar. Breaking the chemical bonds in sugar molecules releases energy that a cell can use.
The atoms from the broken molecules then combine to form different molecules such as carbon dioxide and water. These molecules are different types of matter than sugar and oxygen.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

Explanation: In both scenarios, water is being cooled down. In the case of boiling water on a stove, the heat source is turned off, causing the water to cool down. Similarly, in the case of melting ice, the ice is exposed to warmer air or a warm surface, causing it to melt and cool down. Both processes involve a change in the temperature of the water, but they are different types of changes.","Both are caused by cooling.

Similarly, in the case of melting ice, the ice is exposed to warmer air or a warm surface, causing it to melt and cool down. Both processes involve a change in the temperature of the water, but they are different types of changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Ice melting in a glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not made.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

"Based on this information, what is Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait?","curved whiskers
straight whiskers",0,0,curved whiskers,"Based on the information provided, Stuart has the genotype hh for the whisker type gene, which means he has two copies of the allele for curved whiskers (h). Therefore, his phenotype for the whisker type trait is A. curved whiskers.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The image shows a group of Syrian hamsters, including Stuart, who has the genotype hh for the whisker type gene.
2. The allele for curved whiskers is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers. This means that an individual with two copies of the allele for curved whiskers (hh) will express the curved whisker phenotype, while an individual with two copies of the allele for straight whiskers (HH) will express the straight whisker phenotype.
3. Since Stuart has the genotype hh, he will express the curved whisker phenotype, which is option A.","curved whiskers.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The image shows a group of Syrian hamsters, including Stuart, who has the genotype hh for the whisker type gene.
2. The allele for curved whiskers is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers. This means that an individual with two copies of the allele for curved whiskers (hh) will express the curved whisker phenotype, while an individual with two copies of the allele for straight whiskers (HH) will express the straight whisker phenotype.
3. Since Stuart has the genotype hh, he will express the curved whisker phenotype, which is option A.","Stuart's genotype for the whisker type gene is hh. Stuart's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for curved whiskers. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers.
To check this answer, consider whether Stuart's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Stuart's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0051627437690237536,0.0015865107157226428,0.2679425798539411,0.16666666666666666

The famous Venus de Milo statue was found on Milos, a volcanic Greek island in the Aegean Sea.",0,-1,N/A,"B is a compound sentence.

A sentence that contains two or more independent clauses joined by a conjunction is called a compound sentence. In this case, ""I followed Vicky's recipe, but my chicken pot pie tasted nothing like hers"" is an independent clause because it can be a complete sentence on its own. However, it is not a compound sentence because it does not contain any conjunctions to join the two independent clauses.

On the other hand, ""The famous Venus de Milo statue was found on Milos, a volcanic Greek island in the Aegean Sea"" is also an independent clause because it can be a complete sentence on its own. However, it contains a conjunction ""but"" which connects two independent clauses, making it a compound sentence.

The reasoning behind this answer can be explained step-by-step:

1. ""The famous Venus de Milo statue was found on Milos, a volcanic Greek island in the Aegean Sea"" is an independent clause because it can be a complete sentence on its own.
2. ""but"" is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses.
3. ""I followed Vicky's recipe, but my chicken pot pie tasted nothing like hers"" is also an independent clause because it can be a complete sentence on its own.

Therefore, the sentence ""B"" is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses joined by a conjunction.",,"The second sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction but.
I followed Vicky's recipe, but my chicken pot pie tasted nothing like hers.

A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause is not a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.

neither; their concentrations are the same",2,-1,N/A,Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.,,"In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of pink particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

"What do these two changes have in common?
melting wax
knitting yarn into a scarf","Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.",2,0,Both are chemical changes.,"A. Both are chemical changes.

The commonality between melting wax and knitting yarn into a scarf is that both are chemical changes. In the case of melting wax, the wax molecules are rearranged to form a liquid state, which is a chemical change. Similarly, when yarn is knitted into a scarf, the fibers of the yarn are intertwined to form a new structure, which is also a chemical change. This is because the bonds between the fibers are broken and rearranged to form a new structure.

In the image, the wax is shown melting on a hot plate, which is an example of a chemical change. Similarly, the yarn is shown being knitted into a scarf, which is also an example of a chemical change. Both processes involve the rearrangement of molecules, which is the definition of a chemical change.","Both are chemical changes.

Similarly, the yarn is shown being knitted into a scarf, which is also an example of a chemical change. Both processes involve the rearrangement of molecules, which is the definition of a chemical change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But knitting yarn is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

The producer in this food chain is the slender wheatgrass.

Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer.

The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H), which means that if an individual has two copies of the allele for not having horns (Hh), they will not have horns.

However, if an individual has two copies of the allele for having horns (hh), they will have horns.

Therefore, since Daffodil has the genotype hh, she will have the phenotype of having horns.","Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is hh. Daffodil's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for having horns. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Daffodil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Daffodil's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.

This means that they have one dominant allele (R) and one recessive allele (r). Since the dominant allele is R, it means that Captain will express the bright orange cheeks phenotype.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. Captain has the genotype Rr for the cheek color gene.
2. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).
3. Since Captain has one dominant allele (R) and one recessive allele (r), they will express the bright orange cheeks phenotype.

3. Since Captain has one dominant allele (R) and one recessive allele (r), they will express the bright orange cheeks phenotype.
4. Therefore, Captain has the phenotype of bright orange cheeks.","You need to determine Captain's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Captain's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
Captain's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Captain's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.00039102124609034414,0.00023301230534071555,0.2666666634666667,0.1791044776119403

The image shows a carton of orange juice, which is typically sold in fluid ounce units. One fluid ounce is equivalent to about 1/8 of a cup. Therefore, to find the volume of the carton, we need to multiply the number of fluid ounces by the volume of one fluid ounce.

Since the carton is labeled as containing 65 fluid ounces, we can calculate the volume by multiplying 65 by 1/8, which gives us approximately 8 fluid ounces. Since the carton is full, we can assume that the volume of the carton is equal to the volume of the liquid it contains, which is 8 fluid ounces.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

It's also worth noting that the greeting should be written in capital letters, except for the first word. In this case, the greeting would be written as ""DEAR GRANDMA LUCY."" This is a standard convention for letter writing, and helps to make the letter more formal and polite.","The first greeting is correct:
Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Grandma Lucy is capitalized because it is a proper noun.

A letter starts with a greeting and ends with a closing. For each one, capitalize the first word and end with a comma. You should also capitalize proper nouns, such as Aunt Sue.

The fact that silver is a compound is also supported by its physical and chemical properties, which are characteristic of compounds rather than elementary substances.","You can tell whether silver is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for silver is Ag. This formula contains one symbol: Ag. So, the formula tells you that silver is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, silver is an elementary substance.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.05851839922791101,0.015999939572961086,0.3749999952847366,0.20454545454545456

Therefore, sentence B is more formal than sentence A, and it is the correct answer.","The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses an idiom (like pulling teeth).
The second sentence uses formal language in place of the idiom, so it is more formal overall.

Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.",0.26550025074754324,0.021420865011794143,0.21951219028926244,0.15384615384615385
"Based on this information, what is Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait?","soft fur
rough fur",1,1,rough fur,"Based on the information provided, Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait is B. rough fur.

The image shows that Chance is a dachshund dog, and the group of dachshund dogs includes individuals with both rough and soft fur. The fur texture trait in this group is determined by a gene with two alleles, where the dominant allele is F for rough fur and the recessive allele is f for soft fur. Chance has the heterozygous genotype Ff, which means that he has one dominant allele (F) and one recessive allele (f).

Since the dominant allele (F) is for rough fur, it is likely that Chance will express the rough fur phenotype. Therefore, the answer is B. rough fur.","rough fur.

Since the dominant allele (F) is for rough fur, it is likely that Chance will express the rough fur phenotype. Therefore, the answer is B. rough fur.","You need to determine Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Chance's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chance's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be rough fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.008027249973278599,0.0011017148635487585,0.325358847707699,0.18461538461538463

Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.

The common factor between the two changes is that they are both chemical changes. In the image, a piece of apple is turning brown, which is a characteristic of a chemical change. Chemical changes involve a rearrangement of atoms in a molecule, leading to the formation of new compounds. On the other hand, compost rotting is also a chemical change, as it involves the breakdown of organic matter into simpler compounds through the action of microorganisms. These microorganisms consume the organic matter and release energy in the form of heat, which is why composting produces heat.

A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.",3.0536243137246927e-45,9.656407949838596e-46,0.043010752267314156,0.05

A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.",0.3672463012769101,0.06361065932930685,0.31182795201757435,0.21739130434782608

Bending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Cutting your fingernails is a physical change. Your fingernails are shorter after you cut them. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncut fingernails.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

Therefore, the substance in the image is most likely potassium nitrate (KNO3).","Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for sulfur dioxide contains two symbols: S for sulfur and O for oxygen. So, sulfur dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, sulfur dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for krypton contains one symbol: Kr. So, krypton is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, krypton is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for potassium nitrate contains three symbols: K for potassium, N for nitrogen, and O for oxygen. So, potassium nitrate is made of three chemical elements bonded together.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.0049444189213342345,0.00030517619645332224,0.21590908665547526,0.16326530612244897

The molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom, as indicated by the chemical formula H2S. The black line through the sulfur symbolizes the absence of a bond between the sulfur and the hydrogen atoms, which is a characteristic of sulfur compounds.","H is the symbol for hydrogen. S is the symbol for sulfur. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and S. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There is one sulfur atom, so S will not have a subscript.
The correct formula is H2 S.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule.

To determine the volume of the mustard bottle, I would first need to see the image of the bottle. However, I can provide a general explanation of how to estimate the volume of a bottle.

1. Measure the height of the bottle from the top to the bottom.
2. Measure the diameter of the bottle at the base.
3. Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h.

A tortoise shell is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A tortoise shell is made of a solid called keratin, just like your fingernails!
A pair of dice is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you roll a pair of dice, the dice have a shape of their own. They are still cubes when they stop rolling.
Caramel sauce is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour caramel sauce into a container, the caramel sauce will take the shape of that container. But the caramel sauce will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

Compare the motion of two bowhead whales. Which bowhead whale was moving at a lower speed?,"a bowhead whale that moved 25miles in 10hours
a bowhead whale that moved 60miles in 10hours",0,0,a bowhead whale that moved 25miles in 10hours,"To compare the motion of the two bowhead whales, we need to determine which whale moved at a lower speed. We can do this by comparing the distance traveled by each whale in a given time period.

In the image, we can see that whale A moved 25 miles in 10 hours, while whale B moved 60 miles in the same amount of time. Therefore, we can conclude that whale B moved at a lower speed than whale A.

To further support this conclusion, we can look at the distance traveled by each whale in relation to the time it took them to travel that distance. For example, if whale A moved 25 miles in 10 hours, that means it traveled an average of 2.5 miles per hour. On the other hand, if whale B moved 60 miles in 10 hours, that means it traveled an average of 6 miles per hour. Since whale B's average speed is lower than whale A's, we can confidently say that whale B moved at a lower speed.","To further support this conclusion, we can look at the distance traveled by each whale in relation to the time it took them to travel that distance.

The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Which block of concrete has less thermal energy?,"the colder block of concrete
the hotter block of concrete",0,0,the colder block of concrete,A. the colder block of concrete.,the colder block of concrete.,"The two blocks of concrete are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder block of concrete has less thermal energy.

Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy.",9.14354120317147e-14,7.643318165966712e-14,0.12499999882812501,0.06896551724137931

Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian.

Queenie's observable version of the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks. So, Queenie's phenotype for the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

"What do these two changes have in common?
cutting an apple
a sidewalk heating up in the sun","Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.",3,-1,N/A,"The commonality between cutting an apple and a sidewalk heating up in the sun is that both are physical changes.

In the case of cutting an apple, the physical change occurs as the apple is physically separated into two pieces. This involves the transfer of energy from the apple to the knife, but no new substances are created or transformed. Similarly, when a sidewalk heats up in the sun, the physical change occurs as the sun's energy is absorbed by the sidewalk, causing it to become warmer. Again, no new substances are created or transformed in this process.

Both of these physical changes can be observed and measured, but they do not involve any chemical reactions or transformations. In contrast, chemical changes involve the combination or breakdown of substances, resulting in the formation of new compounds. For example, when an apple is cut and the juice is squeezed out, this is a chemical change because the apple has been chemically transformed into juice. Similarly, when a fire occurs, it is a chemical change because the combustion of fuel is releasing energy in the form of new compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor.",,"Step 1: Think about each change.
Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple.
A sidewalk heating up in the sun is a physical change. The temperature of the sidewalk goes up, but the sidewalk is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
A sidewalk getting warm in the sun is caused by heating. But cutting an apple is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Zelda's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for white spots. So, Zelda's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.
To check this answer, consider whether Zelda's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Zelda's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Zelda's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.01643068379099585,0.006044956066386234,0.35071089644527303,0.24242424242424243

Nibbles's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a normal-sized body. So, Nibbles's phenotype for the body size trait must be a normal-sized body.
To check this answer, consider whether Nibbles's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Nibbles's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nibbles's phenotype for the body size trait must be a normal-sized body.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0009397849587929164,0.00021740781916656203,0.3131313096745231,0.1875

Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?,Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?,"Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",2.7350488646829952e-09,1.9531433883878074e-10,0.05769230565088765,0.0

The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart.",5.613887241577545e-05,3.1230140419847974e-05,0.23188405529090525,0.14285714285714285

At twenty-one, Jonathan felt overwhelmed with adult responsibilities and wished he could fly off to Neverland.","allusion
simile",0,0,allusion,"The correct answer is A. allusion.

In the given text, the figure of speech used is an allusion. An allusion is a reference to a person, place, event, or thing that is not explicitly mentioned but is implied or suggested. In this case, the reference to Neverland is an allusion to Peter Pan, a fictional character created by J.M. Barrie. The phrase ""wished he could fly off to Neverland"" is an allusion to Peter Pan's famous line, ""All that glitters is not gold, Your majesty. Spend a year in Never-land, and at the end of it you'll have a beard!""

The allusion in the text is significant because it adds depth and meaning to the sentence.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",2.970445045520691e-73,5.282281263101575e-74,0.02298850551988374,0.03125

A compound sentence is a sentence that contains two or more independent clauses joined by a conjunction. In this case, the sentence contains two independent clauses joined by ""or.""

In the sentence ""You might be excited by all of the people and activity in Tokyo, or it might be a bit overwhelming,"" ""You might be excited"" and ""it might be a bit overwhelming"" are both independent clauses. They are joined by the conjunction ""or,"" which indicates that one of the clauses can be true without the other one being true.

In contrast, the sentence ""The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch"" is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses joined by a conjunction. The first independent clause is ""The package includes,"" and the second independent clause is ""some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch."" These two clauses are joined by the conjunction ""and,"" which indicates that both clauses must be true in order for the sentence to be true.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.",,"The second sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction or.

Which drop of honey has less thermal energy?,"the hotter drop of honey
the colder drop of honey",1,1,the colder drop of honey,"The correct answer is B. the colder drop of honey.

The image shows two drops of honey, one hot and one cold. The hot drop of honey has more thermal energy than the cold drop of honey because it is closer to the boiling point of honey, which is around 157 degrees Fahrenheit (68 degrees Celsius). The cold drop of honey has less thermal energy because it is closer to the melting point of honey, which is around 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).

The hot drop of honey is more viscous and has a higher density than the cold drop of honey. This is because the hot honey has more thermal energy, which causes the molecules to move faster and be more closely packed together. The cold honey, on the other hand, has less thermal energy and is more fluid.

Therefore, the hot drop of honey has more thermal energy than the cold drop of honey, making the cold drop the one with less thermal energy.","the colder drop of honey.

The dependent variable is the number of leaves on the mint plants.,,"Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

To arrive at this estimate, I used the image of a standard bathtub as a reference. The bathtub in the image has a rectangular shape with rounded corners, which is a common design for residential bathtubs. The dimensions of the bathtub are approximately 1.5 meters long, 0.75 meters wide, and 0.75 meters deep.

To calculate the volume of the bathtub, I used the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Plugging in the dimensions of the bathtub, I got V = 1.5m x 0.75m x 0.75m = 10.25 cubic meters.

However, since the volume of a bathtub is typically expressed in liters, I converted the volume from cubic meters to liters by dividing it by 1,000,000. This gave me a volume of 10.25 liters.

Therefore, my reasoning is that the volume of a standard bathtub is approximately 320 liters, which is a reasonable estimate based on the dimensions of the bathtub in the image.","320 liters.

"Based on this information, what is Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait?","wavy fur
straight fur",0,-1,N/A,"Based on the information provided, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait is wavy fur. This is because the allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive, meaning that it is expressed only when both alleles are present. Since Biscotti has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene, it is certain that both alleles are present, and therefore Biscotti will have wavy fur.

In the image, Biscotti is described as having ""wavy"" fur, which is the phenotype associated with the genotype ff. This is in contrast to the straight fur phenotype, which is associated with the genotype Ff. Since Biscotti has the genotype ff, it is reasonable to assume that he will have the wavy fur phenotype.",,"Biscotti's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Biscotti's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Biscotti's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Biscotti's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Do bananas develop more brown spots if they are kept in bags with holes compared to bags without holes?,Do bananas develop more brown spots if they are kept in bags with holes compared to bags without holes?,"Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",8.948894277849674e-07,6.121096584918604e-08,0.07272726999008276,0.0

"What do these two changes have in common?
shaking up salad dressing
breaking a piece of glass","Both are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.",2,2,Both are only physical changes.,"The commonality between shaking up salad dressing and breaking a piece of glass is that both are physical changes.

In the image, it is shown that shaking up salad dressing and breaking a piece of glass are two different physical changes. When salad dressing is shaken, the molecules in the liquid become agitated, which results in a temporary increase in temperature and a change in the dressing's consistency. However, after the shaking stops, the temperature and consistency of the dressing return to their original state. This is a physical change because it involves a change in the dressing's properties without a change in its chemical composition.

Similarly, when a piece of glass is broken, the material undergoes a physical change. The glass breaks due to a sudden impact or force, which causes the molecules in the glass to reorganize and form new bonds. However, after the breakage, the chemical composition of the glass remains the same. This is also a physical change because it involves a change in the glass's properties without a change in its chemical composition.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are physical changes.",Both are physical changes.,"Step 1: Think about each change.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Breaking a piece of glass is a physical change. The glass gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",1.265298507693947e-33,5.983227232678953e-34,0.0701754379193598,0.02127659574468085

A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for propane is C3 H8. This formula contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that propane is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, propane is a compound.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom.

A simple sentence is a type of sentence that has a single independent clause and no dependent clauses. In this sentence, ""Larry picked raspberries in the field until his fingertips were stained red"" is an independent clause because it contains a subject (""Larry"") and a verb (""picked""), and it can stand alone as a complete thought. There are no dependent clauses in the sentence, such as ""until his fingertips were stained red"" which would make the sentence more complex.

In contrast, B is a complex sentence.

B is a complex sentence because it contains a dependent clause (""Henry Bacon's design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C."") which modifies the noun ""design"" and gives additional information about it. The dependent clause ""in Washington, D.C."" also adds information about the location of the design.

This is a typical formula for a compound, and it is consistent with the definition of a compound as a substance made up of two or more different elements combined in a fixed proportion.","You can tell whether potassium nitrate is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for potassium nitrate is KNO3. This formula contains three symbols: K for potassium, N for nitrogen, and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that potassium nitrate is made of three chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, potassium nitrate is a compound.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.021413457968591957,0.006148694263670393,0.361445778875744,0.2

First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!",6.512720118797812e-10,8.540903212941374e-11,0.055045870044609084,0.02564102564102564

It is typically formed through geological processes and has a relatively uniform chemical composition throughout. In contrast, a shark's tooth is a biological structure made by a living organism, specifically a shark. Shark's teeth are composed of dentin, which is a mineralized protein matrix, and enamel, which is a hard, mineralized tissue. Therefore, a shark's tooth is not a pure substance, as it is made up of both organic and inorganic materials.

Muscovite is a mineral.
A shark's tooth is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
A shark's tooth is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, a shark's tooth is not a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

Both of these changes involve the movement of molecules, but they are triggered by different temperature changes. Boiling occurs when the water molecules gain enough energy to escape from the liquid and become a gas. This requires heating, or an increase in temperature. On the other hand, melting occurs when the ice molecules lose enough energy to become a liquid. This requires cooling, or a decrease in temperature.

In the image, there are two different scenarios where water is changing state. In the first scenario, water is boiling, which is a change in state caused by heating. However, in the second scenario, ice is melting, which is a change in state caused by cooling.

Both of these changes involve the movement of molecules, but they are triggered by different temperature changes. Boiling occurs when the water molecules gain enough energy to escape from the liquid and become a gas. This requires heating, or an increase in temperature. On the other hand, melting occurs when the ice molecules lose enough energy to become a liquid. This requires cooling, or a decrease in temperature.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Both are caused by cooling.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from solid to liquid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.
Bending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water freezing is caused by cooling. But bending a paper clip is not.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.11144984705915763,0.022003697561253657,0.27624308917920704,0.22727272727272727
"Which tense does the sentence use?
Two hawks rest in the tree.","present tense
past tense
future tense",0,0,present tense,"The sentence uses the present tense.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence describes a situation that is currently happening or has recently happened.
2. The use of the present tense indicates that the action of the sentence is taking place at the time the sentence was written or is happening now.
3. The sentence specifically states ""Two hawks rest in the tree,"" which is a factual statement about the current state of the hawks.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. present tense.",present tense.,"The sentence is in present tense. You can tell because it uses a present-tense verb, rest. The verb tells you about something that is true or happening now.

Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.
Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.

Grape juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour grape juice into a different container, the grape juice will take the shape of that container. But the grape juice will still take up the same amount of space.
A screwdriver is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. This screwdriver has a metal blade and a plastic handle. Both metal and plastic are solids.
A hammer is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A hammer is made of iron and wood. Both iron and wood are solids.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",2.470010363869359e-79,7.810858594048445e-80,0.03007518767369552,0.04

Therefore, his genotype is BFF, where B represents the long fur allele and F represents the short fur allele.",,"An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Digby has two alleles for short fur (F). So, Digby's genotype for the fur length gene is FF.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence is in the present tense because it describes an action that will happen in the future. The use of ""before bed"" implies that the action of reading the book has not yet happened, but it will happen in the future.
2. The present tense is used to describe actions that will happen in the future, as opposed to the past or present tense.
3. The present tense is used to describe future actions because it is the tense that is used to describe actions that have not yet happened and will happen in the future.
4. The sentence ""Dustin will read his book before bed"" is written in the present tense, which is the correct tense to use when describing future actions.",,"The sentence is in future tense.

"What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a plate
cutting your fingernails","Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.",2,2,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both breaking a plate and cutting your fingernails are physical changes.

Physical changes involve a change in the physical properties of a substance or object, such as shape, size, or state, but do not involve a change in the chemical composition. Breaking a plate is an example of a physical change because it involves a change in the shape and size of the plate, but the chemical composition of the plate remains the same. Similarly, cutting your fingernails is also a physical change because it involves a change in the shape and size of your fingernails, but the chemical composition of your fingernails remains the same.

In contrast, chemical changes involve a change in the chemical composition of a substance or object, such as the conversion of sugar into glucose or the combustion of gasoline. These changes produce new substances with different properties, such as different colors, smells, or tastes.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both breaking a plate and cutting your fingernails are physical changes because they involve changes in the physical properties of objects or substances, but do not involve changes in their chemical composition.","Both breaking a plate and cutting your fingernails are physical changes.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both breaking a plate and cutting your fingernails are physical changes because they involve changes in the physical properties of objects or substances, but do not involve changes in their chemical composition.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Cutting your fingernails is a physical change. Your fingernails are shorter after you cut them. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncut fingernails.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

The author of the text is making the assumption that the increase in park funding caused the increase in littering, simply because they happened together. However, this is not a valid conclusion.

There could be other factors that contributed to the increase in littering, such as a change in weather patterns or an increase in the number of visitors to the park.

The image shows a log being sawed in half and a rubber band being stretched. Both of these actions involve physical changes to the log and the rubber band, but they do not involve any chemical reactions or changes in the composition of the materials. Sawing a log in half involves cutting the log into two pieces, which is a physical change because the log's shape and size have changed. Similarly, stretching a rubber band involves applying force to the band, causing it to elongate, which is also a physical change because the rubber band's shape and size have changed.","Both are only physical changes.

Similarly, stretching a rubber band involves applying force to the band, causing it to elongate, which is also a physical change because the rubber band's shape and size have changed.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log splits into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter.
Stretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.07369403299846403,0.02161521035041958,0.30120481469516625,0.21739130434782608

Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.

Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:

The student council requested that more lockers be installed immediately to accommodate the incoming freshman class.",1,1,The student council requested that more lockers be installed immediately to accommodate the incoming freshman class.,"B. The student council requested that more lockers be installed immediately to accommodate the incoming freshman class.

My reasoning is as follows:

Firstly, the sentence ""ASAP"" is an abbreviation for ""as soon as possible,"" which is a more informal way of saying ""immediately."" In contrast, ""immediately"" is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Therefore, sentence B is more formal than sentence A.

Secondly, the sentence ""to accommodate the incoming freshman class"" is a specific and concrete reason for the request, which is important in a formal context. It shows that the student council has a clear purpose for their request and is able to articulate it in a clear and concise manner.

Finally, the sentence ""to accommodate the incoming freshman class"" is written in a passive voice, which is often used in formal writing to convey a sense of objectivity and neutrality. This further contributes to the formality of the sentence.

In the case of baking cookies, the cookies undergo a physical change as they expand and become more firm due to the heat from the oven. This is evident from the image of the cookies rising and becoming more solid as they bake.

Similarly, when rust forms on a metal gate, it is also a physical change. Rust is a reddish-brown substance that forms on the surface of the metal when it reacts with oxygen and water. The metal gate undergoes a physical transformation as the rust forms, creating a new substance with a different appearance and texture.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are physical changes.",Both are physical changes.,"Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. Cookies are made from cookie dough. Baking turns the cookie dough into cookies. The cookies are a different type of matter than the dough.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.

Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",2.4426007377405277e-36,5.869108932816911e-37,0.06779660951450732,0.02

As the water balloon fell towards Dale, its gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth increased. This is because the force of gravity acting on the water balloon increased as it fell, and the potential energy of the balloon increased in response. The potential energy of an object is directly proportional to the force of gravity acting on it and the height from which it falls. Since the water balloon fell from a higher position and towards Dale, its potential energy increased.","increased

The potential energy of an object is directly proportional to the force of gravity acting on it and the height from which it falls. Since the water balloon fell from a higher position and towards Dale, its potential energy increased.","Think about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.
Dale was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Dale, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Dale.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases

"Is chocolate syrup a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a gas
a liquid
a solid",1,2,a solid,C. a solid,a solid,"Chocolate syrup is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",9.462629465836378e-57,2.992346176626543e-57,0.035714285363520414,0.02631578947368421

In a complete sentence, there are two main parts: a subject and a predicate. The subject is a noun or pronoun that identifies who or what is performing the action, and the predicate is the verb and any accompanying words that describe the action.

In B, the subject is ""this book,"" and the predicate is ""explains the difference between cattle and buffalo."" The verb ""explains"" is a linking verb that connects the subject to the predicate, and the subject and predicate together form a complete thought.

In contrast, A is not a complete sentence because it lacks a predicate. The subject ""Amy"" is not enough information to complete the sentence. It could be interpreted as a fragment or a sentence fragment, which is a incomplete sentence that is not grammatically correct.
