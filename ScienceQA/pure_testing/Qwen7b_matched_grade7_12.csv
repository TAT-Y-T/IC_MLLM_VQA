whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",1,1,how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour,"The correct answer is:

B. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour

Explanation:
The image shows a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel, which is being used to simulate the conditions under which the parachute will operate during the landing of the spacecraft on Mars. The purpose of this test is to determine how stable the parachute will be at the high speeds expected during the landing phase. By observing the behavior of the parachute with a 1 m vent at 200 km per hour, Gordon can assess whether the parachute will swing too much, which could potentially damage the spacecraft. This test directly addresses the concern about the stability of the parachute at such high speeds, making option B the most appropriate choice.","how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour

Explanation: Guide words in a dictionary are placed at the top of each page to indicate the range of words that can be found on that page. The guide words ""shot"" and ""suit"" suggest that the page contains words that start with letters between 's' and 't'. 

- ""Service"" starts with 's', which fits within this range.

What is the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece? Choose the most likely ratio.,"0:4
4:0
2:2
1:3
3:1",1,1,4:0,"The correct answer is B. 4:0.

Explanation:
In the Punnett square provided, both parents are homozygous recessive for woolly fleece (ff). When two recessive alleles (f) combine, the offspring will all inherit one f allele from each parent, resulting in ff. Since ff represents woolly fleece, all four offspring will have woolly fleece. Therefore, the ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to those with a hairy fleece is 4:0.","4:0.

Explanation:
In the Punnett square provided, both parents are homozygous recessive for woolly fleece (ff). When two recessive alleles (f) combine, the offspring will all inherit one f allele from each parent, resulting in ff. Since ff represents woolly fleece, all four offspring will have woolly fleece. Therefore, the ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to those with a hairy fleece is 4:0.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.
A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0023902639444424,0.0009360941385326,0.3085714245903673,0.2340425531914893,8
"Using only these supplies, which question can Farid investigate with an experiment?","Does a pie crust made with white flour burn more quickly when the pie is cooked in a glass pan or in an aluminum pan?

Here's why:

1. **Supplies Available**: Farid has two pie crusts made with white flour, one glass pie pan, and one aluminum pie pan. These supplies directly relate to the materials needed to compare the burning rates of pie crusts in different types of pans.

2. **Experiment Design**: The experiment involves comparing the burning rate of the same type of pie crust (made with white flour) in two different types of pans (glass and aluminum). This setup allows Farid to isolate the variable of the pan material while keeping all other factors constant (such as the type of flour, the thickness of the crust, and the oven temperature).

3. **Controlled Variables**: By using the same pie crusts and oven, Farid can control for variables like the amount of filling used, the oven temperature, and the cooking time. This ensures that any differences observed in the burning rate are due to the type of pan rather than other variables.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Farid can hypothesize that the pie crust may burn differently in glass versus aluminum pans due to their thermal properties. Glass pans typically have lower heat conductivity compared to metal pans, so the crust might burn more slowly in a glass pan.

The other options cannot be investigated with the given supplies because:
- Option B requires aluminum foil, which is not mentioned among the supplies.
- Option C would require a second type of pie crust (whole wheat flour), which is also not provided.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

Explanation:
According to Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, if Darnel is pushing on his friend's wheelchair, then the wheelchair must be pushing back with an equal and opposite force on Darnel. This is because the action (Darnel pushing) and the reaction (the wheelchair pushing back) are always paired in this way. Therefore, the correct choice is A.","The wheelchair is pushing on Darnel.

What is the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit? Choose the most likely ratio.,"3:1
2:2
1:3
4:0
0:4",3,0,3:1,"The correct answer is A. 3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, we can see that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the fruit texture trait in the offspring. The combinations are as follows:

- FF (top left)
- Ff (top right)
- FF (bottom left)
- Ff (bottom right)

Since the allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f), any offspring with at least one F allele will have smooth fruit. Therefore, all four combinations (FF and Ff) result in smooth fruit.

Thus, the ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0, which simplifies to 3:1 when considering the dominance of the smooth fruit allele.","3:1.

Since the allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f), any offspring with at least one F allele will have smooth fruit. Therefore, all four combinations (FF and Ff) result in smooth fruit.

Thus, the ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0, which simplifies to 3:1 when considering the dominance of the smooth fruit allele.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.
Smooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Fuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with fuzzy fruit.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0400172315379041,0.016291463819688,0.3350253762549924,0.2653061224489796,8
"What do these two changes have in common?

burning a marshmallow over a campfire","Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.",2,0,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is:

A. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- **Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas**: This process involves dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) changing directly into a gas without passing through the liquid phase. This is a physical change because no new substance is formed; it's simply a change in state from solid to gas due to an increase in temperature or pressure, which causes the molecules to spread out more widely.
  
- **Burning a marshmallow over a campfire**: This process involves a chemical change where the marshmallow undergoes combustion, a reaction with oxygen that produces carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases as well as heat. The marshmallow itself is transformed into different substances, indicating a chemical change.

Therefore, both processes described involve physical changes rather than chemical ones.","Both are only physical changes.

The marshmallow itself is transformed into different substances, indicating a chemical change.

Therefore, both processes described involve physical changes rather than chemical ones.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Dry ice sublimating is a physical change. But burning a marshmallow is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. But dry ice sublimating is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0645904306884133,0.0139995537771418,0.283185835864594,0.3275862068965517,7

A. understatement

Explanation:
An understatement is a figure of speech where something is described as less severe or important than it actually is. In this case, the dinner guest is using an understatement to describe the impact of the Grim Reaper's visit. Instead of saying something like ""That was a very scary experience,"" the guest says ""Well, that's cast rather a gloom over the evening, hasn't it?"" This implies that the visit was not just scary but also had a significant negative effect on the evening, which is an understated way of expressing the gravity of the situation.

Option B, antithesis, refers to a figure of speech where two contrasting ideas are expressed in parallel structure. While the text does contain contrasting ideas (""scary"" vs. ""gloom""), it is not structured in parallel form, so it does not fit the definition of antithesis.

"Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Norwood. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Norwood?","The supply probably went up.
The supply probably went down.",1,1,The supply probably went down.,"The correct answer is:

B. The supply probably went down.

Explanation:
The number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Norwood has decreased from seven to three. This reduction in the number of stores typically indicates that fewer suppliers are available to meet the demand for men's shirts. When the number of suppliers decreases, it generally leads to a decrease in the overall supply of the product (in this case, men's shirts) because each supplier may not be able to produce or distribute as much as before due to reduced competition and possibly increased costs associated with operating fewer stores. Therefore, the supply of men's shirts in Norwood likely went down.","The supply probably went down.

Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly.

"Based on this information, what is Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?","a black coat
a spotted coat",1,1,a spotted coat,"The correct answer is B. a spotted coat.

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup). The question provides that the gene for the coat pattern trait in jaguars has two alleles: A (for a black coat) and a (for a spotted coat). It also states that the allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).

Since Hari has the homozygous genotype aa, he has two copies of the recessive allele for a spotted coat. Because the allele for a spotted coat is recessive, the presence of two copies of this allele will result in the expression of the spotted coat phenotype. Therefore, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a spotted coat.","a spotted coat.

The question provides that the gene for the coat pattern trait in jaguars has two alleles: A (for a black coat) and a (for a spotted coat). It also states that the allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).

Since Hari has the homozygous genotype aa, he has two copies of the recessive allele for a spotted coat. Because the allele for a spotted coat is recessive, the presence of two copies of this allele will result in the expression of the spotted coat phenotype. Therefore, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a spotted coat.","Hari's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Hari's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Hari's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Hari's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0223207963769433,0.0095592909311817,0.3333333291259431,0.1846153846153846,7

An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0205409052942838,0.0034660869390704,0.2658959494630626,0.2666666666666666,8
Identify the question that Jaden and Ron's experiment can best answer.,"Do ping pong balls travel farther when launched from a 30° angle compared to a 45° angle?
Do ping pong balls stop rolling along the ground sooner after being launched from a 30° angle or a 45° angle?",0,0,Do ping pong balls travel farther when launched from a 30° angle compared to a 45° angle?,"The correct answer is:

A. Do ping pong balls travel farther when launched from a 30° angle compared to a 45° angle?

Explanation: The experiment described by Jaden and Ron involves launching ping pong balls at two different angles (30° and 45°) using a catapult and measuring the distance each ball travels. The goal of their experiment is to compare the distances traveled by the balls at these two angles. Therefore, the question that their experiment can best answer is whether ping pong balls travel farther when launched from a 30° angle compared to a 45° angle.","Do ping pong balls travel farther when launched from a 30° angle compared to a 45° angle?

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

A. After an accident, the limb is too badly injured to heal.

Explanation:
Limb amputation is typically performed when a limb is so severely damaged that it cannot heal properly. This can occur due to various reasons such as extensive trauma from accidents, severe infections (like gangrene), or certain medical conditions that cause irreversible damage to the tissues. In these cases, the damaged parts of the limb do not have the capacity to regenerate or heal, leading to the need for amputation to prevent further complications or to ensure the patient's overall health and well-being.

Explanation:
A paradox is a statement that seems to contradict itself or itself appears to be self-contradictory but is actually true.

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

Explanation: Ethane is a compound because it consists of two different types of atoms bonded together, specifically two carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. In the molecular model provided, each black sphere represents a carbon atom, and each white sphere represents a hydrogen atom. Since there are different types of atoms in the molecule, it qualifies as a compound rather than an elementary substance, which would consist of only one type of atom.","a compound.

Why might a person have a limb amputated?,"The limb has healed from a serious disease.
The limb cannot recover from an infection.",1,1,The limb cannot recover from an infection.,"The correct answer is:

B. The limb cannot recover from an infection.

Explanation:
Limb amputation is typically performed as a last resort when a limb is severely damaged beyond the point where it can heal naturally. This can happen due to infections that do not respond to treatment, such as gangrene caused by bacterial infections. Infections in limbs can spread rapidly and become life-threatening if left untreated. Amputation is necessary to prevent the infection from spreading to other parts of the body and to save the patient's life.

Additionally, severe injuries to limbs can result in extensive damage to the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves. If this damage is so extensive that it cannot be repaired through natural healing processes, amputation becomes necessary to remove the affected part and prevent further complications. This is particularly true for injuries that involve significant tissue loss or damage that would make the limb non-functional even after treatment.","The limb cannot recover from an infection.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A
sample B",1,1,sample A,"B. sample A

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is its speed, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 40 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 950 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 32 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 750 m/s

Calculating the kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \, \text{u} \times (950 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 \, \text{u} \times (750 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B, but the speed of the particles in Sample A is also greater, we need to consider both factors. However, the speed factor plays a more significant role because it is squared in the kinetic energy equation. Therefore, even though the mass of the particles in Sample A is larger, the higher speed of the particles in Sample A results in a higher average kinetic energy compared to Sample B.

Thus, Sample A has the higher temperature.","sample A

So, dolerite is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

A. Ernesto's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Ernesto inherited a trait, specifically having hazel eyes. Inheritance refers to the passing on of genetic traits from parents to offspring. 

- Option A suggests that Ernesto's biological father has hazel eyes, which could imply that Ernesto might have inherited this trait from him. However, it does not explicitly state that Ernesto's father wears contacts; it only mentions that he has hazel eyes. This is a reasonable inference but not a definitive proof of inheritance.

- Option B states that Ernesto wears glasses and so do his sisters. This information about Ernesto wearing glasses is unrelated to the inheritance of eye color and does not provide any support for the conclusion that Ernesto inherited his eye color from anyone.

- Option C indicates that Ernesto's friend has hazel eyes. This information is about someone who is not related to Ernesto (his friend) and therefore cannot be used to conclude that Ernesto inherited his eye color from this person.

Given the options provided, the most relevant piece of information that supports the conclusion that Ernesto inherited his hazel eyes is option A, as it directly relates to Ernesto's biological father having hazel eyes, which could be a genetic trait that Ernesto may have inherited.","Ernesto's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample B
sample A",1,1,sample B,"B. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average particle speed is the same for both samples (1,400 m/s), we need to consider the mass of the particles to determine which sample has the higher temperature.

The average kinetic energy (KE) of a particle is given by the formula:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is the velocity (speed) of the particle.

For Sample A, the mass of each particle is 44 u and the average speed is 1,400 m/s. Therefore, the average kinetic energy for a particle in Sample A is:

\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 44 \, \text{u} \times (1,400 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average speed is also 1,400 m/s. Therefore, the average kinetic energy for a particle in Sample B is:

\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (1,400 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the speed \( v \) is the same for both samples, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Because the mass of the particles in Sample B (46 u) is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A (44 u), the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A.

Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

For Sample B, the mass of each particle is 46 u and the average speed is also 1,400 m/s. Therefore, the average kinetic energy for a particle in Sample B is:

\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (1,400 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the speed \( v \) is the same for both samples, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Because the mass of the particles in Sample B (46 u) is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A (44 u), the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A.

Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.3911290322580645,0.1414786210693452,0.4122137359477886,0.8125,7

Explanation: Concentration is defined as the amount of solute (in this case, the green particles) dissolved in a given amount of solvent. In both Solution A and Solution B, there are four green particles in 20 mL of solvent. Therefore, the number of solute particles per unit volume of solvent is the same in both solutions, indicating that they have the same concentration.","neither; their concentrations are the same

In both Solution A and Solution B, there are four green particles in 20 mL of solvent. Therefore, the number of solute particles per unit volume of solvent is the same in both solutions, indicating that they have the same concentration.","In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.1171153956205829,0.0342014306345137,0.3636363590955005,0.2903225806451613,7

"What do these two changes have in common?
a slice of banana turning brown
chicken cooking in an oven","Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.",1,1,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **A slice of banana turning brown**: This is a chemical change because it involves the oxidation of the banana, where the enzyme polyphenol oxidase reacts with oxygen to form melanin, which gives the banana its brown color. This process is not reversible and is a chemical reaction.

- **Chicken cooking in an oven**: This is also a chemical change because cooking involves various reactions such as Maillard browning (where amino acids and reducing sugars react to form new compounds), denaturation of proteins, and caramelization of sugars. These changes are irreversible and are chemical processes that occur during the cooking process.

Both scenarios involve chemical changes rather than physical changes, as there are new substances formed in each case. Heating can cause both of these changes, but it is not the defining characteristic of what they have in common; rather, it is the chemical reactions that take place due to the heat that causes the changes. Therefore, option C (Both are caused by heating) is not the best choice since heating is a factor in both cases but not the defining characteristic of the changes themselves.","Both are chemical changes.

A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
Cooking chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But a slice of banana turning brown is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.1750480712473968,0.03306940263508,0.2583333283458334,0.2950819672131147,7

Cindy's biological mother often wears her straight hair in a ponytail.",2,0,Cindy's biological parents have red hair. Cindy also has red hair.,"The correct answer is:

A. Cindy's biological parents have red hair. Cindy also has red hair.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Cindy inherited a trait, specifically the trait of having straight hair. The hint provided states that Cindy has straight hair. To determine if Cindy inherited this trait, we need to look at genetic information that can be passed down from her parents.

- Option A directly links Cindy's hair type (straight) to her biological parents' hair color (red). This suggests a possible genetic link because traits like hair color and texture can be inherited. If Cindy's parents both have red hair, it could indicate a genetic predisposition for red hair, which might also influence hair texture such as straightness or curliness.

- Option B mentions Cindy's neighbor's hair type but does not provide any familial connection or genetic information about Cindy's parents or herself. Therefore, this option does not support the conclusion that Cindy inherited the trait.

- Option C talks about Cindy's mother's hairstyle (wearing her hair in a ponytail), which is a behavioral aspect rather than a genetic trait. It does not provide any information about the genetic inheritance of hair texture.

Thus, the most relevant and supportive information for concluding that Cindy inherited the trait of having straight hair is found in Option A.","Cindy's biological parents have red hair. Cindy also has red hair.

Explanation:
A hasty generalization occurs when someone makes a broad claim or conclusion based on insufficient evidence or a small sample size. In this case, the speaker makes a sweeping statement about all people in a big city being ""not polite"" after only observing a few individuals who did not stop to give directions. This is an example of a hasty generalization because it assumes that the behavior of a few individuals represents the entire population of the city.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample A

neither; the samples have the same temperature",1,1,sample B,"B. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is its velocity, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 17 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 1,100 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 36 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 1,300 m/s

Calculating the kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \, \text{u} \times (1,100 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 \, \text{u} \times (1,300 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the average particle speed in Sample B is also greater, the product of mass and the square of the speed will be larger for Sample B. Therefore, Sample B has a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.","sample B

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the average particle speed in Sample B is also greater, the product of mass and the square of the speed will be larger for Sample B. Therefore, Sample B has a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.","Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.

A. Tisha's little brother looked a little nauseous after eating mounds of candy and then going on the dizzying rides at the state fair.

Explanation: In this context, ""nauseous"" is used in its traditional sense as an adjective meaning ""causing nausea."" The phrase ""looked a little nauseous"" implies that the brother felt unwell due to the candy and the rides, which aligns with the traditional use of the word. 

In contrast, option B uses ""nauseous"" as a descriptor for the rides, which is not the traditional usage. The word ""nauseous"" in this case would be more appropriately replaced by ""dizzying"" or another word that describes the nature of the rides. Therefore, option A correctly uses the word ""nauseous"" in its traditional sense.","Tisha's little brother looked a little nauseous after eating mounds of candy and then going on the dizzying rides at the state fair.

Explanation: In this context, ""nauseous"" is used in its traditional sense as an adjective meaning ""causing nausea."" The phrase ""looked a little nauseous"" implies that the brother felt unwell due to the candy and the rides, which aligns with the traditional use of the word. 

In contrast, option B uses ""nauseous"" as a descriptor for the rides, which is not the traditional usage. The word ""nauseous"" in this case would be more appropriately replaced by ""dizzying"" or another word that describes the nature of the rides.

What information supports the conclusion that Darren inherited this trait?,"Darren and his biological mother have pale skin.
Darren's biological parents have freckles on their noses just as Darren does.
Darren has freckles on his nose and shoulders.",1,1,Darren's biological parents have freckles on their noses just as Darren does.,"The correct answer is:

B. Darren's biological parents have freckles on their noses just as Darren does.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Darren inherited a trait. In genetics, traits are passed from parents to offspring through genes. If Darren has freckles on his nose and shoulders, and his biological parents also have freckles on their noses, it suggests that Darren likely inherited the gene for freckles from his parents. This is because freckles are often a hereditary trait, meaning they can be passed down from generation to generation through genetic inheritance.

Option A is not relevant because having pale skin in both Darren and his biological mother could be due to various factors such as environmental exposure to sunlight or other genetic traits related to skin pigmentation, but it does not specifically support the inheritance of freckles.

Option C is partially correct but not as strong evidence as option B. While it shows that Darren has freckles, it doesn't provide direct evidence of inheritance since freckles could also be acquired later in life or due to other factors.

Therefore, option B provides the most direct evidence supporting the conclusion that Darren inherited the trait of having freckles.","Darren's biological parents have freckles on their noses just as Darren does.

Explanation: 
To determine what Turner and Mona can trade to each get what they want, we need to look at the items they both want but do not have in their own lunches. 

- Turner wants a hot dog, tomatoes, and water, but he has a sandwich, oranges, broccoli, and water.
- Mona wants a sandwich, oranges, and broccoli, but she has a hot dog, tomatoes, almonds, and water.

From this, we can see that:
- Turner needs tomatoes and water.
- Mona needs a sandwich, oranges, and broccoli.

However, there is no direct match between what Turner needs and what Mona has, and vice versa. But if we look at the options provided:
- Option A suggests a trade of tomatoes for broccoli, but neither Turner nor Mona has tomatoes or broccoli to trade.
- Option B mentions carrots, which are not listed as either Turner's or Mona's desired items.
- Option C suggests a trade of broccoli for oranges, but neither Turner nor Mona has broccoli or oranges to trade.
- Option D suggests a trade of almonds for tomatoes. Since almonds are on Mona's list of items she wants and tomatoes are on Turner's list of items he wants, this is a feasible trade.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Mona can trade her almonds for Turner's tomatoes.","Mona can trade her almonds for Turner's tomatoes.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average particle speed is the same for both samples (1,800 m/s), we need to consider the mass of the particles to determine which sample has the higher temperature.

- Sample A has particles with a mass of 26 u.
- Sample B has particles with a mass of 28 u.

Since the average kinetic energy of a particle is given by the formula \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is the velocity, the particle in Sample B will have a slightly higher kinetic energy due to its greater mass, even though their speeds are the same.

Therefore, Sample B, with the heavier particles, has the higher average kinetic energy and thus the higher temperature.","sample B.

burning a candle","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",1,1,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- A piece of pizza rotting in a trashcan involves a series of chemical reactions that break down the organic matter in the pizza, leading to the release of gases and the formation of new substances. This process is not just cooling but rather a decomposition reaction that occurs over time due to microbial activity.

- Burning a candle is also a chemical change. It involves the combustion of the wax and the wick, which combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide and water vapor, along with heat and light as byproducts. This is a chemical reaction where the original materials (wax and wick) are transformed into new substances.

Both processes involve chemical changes, not physical ones, and they are not primarily caused by cooling or heating. Therefore, options A, C, and D can be eliminated.","Both are chemical changes.

Both processes involve chemical changes, not physical ones, and they are not primarily caused by cooling or heating. Therefore, options A, C, and D can be eliminated.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But a piece of pizza rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

There is no evidence provided to support the claim that Gina's sister's viewing habits reflect on Gina's own viewing habits, making this a fallacious argument.","The text argues that Gina must watch reality television, because her sister watches reality television. However, even though Gina's sister watches reality television, that doesn't necessarily mean that Gina does, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.

In this context, ""literally"" is used in its traditional sense, meaning ""in fact"" or ""actually."" The sentence states that the Rialto Bridge in Venice is hundreds of years old but still functional, which aligns with the traditional usage of ""literally"" to emphasize the actual age of the bridge.

Option B uses ""literally"" in a hyperbolic or figurative way, suggesting an exaggerated age for the bridge (a million years old), which is not a typical use of the word in its traditional sense.","In this context, ""literally"" is used in its traditional sense, meaning ""in fact"" or ""actually.""

Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect.

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage.

Explanation:
In this scenario, Ms. Thompson suggests that students should be allowed to choose statistics over algebra for graduation. The response to this suggestion is not addressing the actual proposal but instead dismisses algebra as ""useless."" This is a straw man fallacy because it distorts Ms. Thompson's actual argument (allowing students to choose between statistics and algebra) by presenting a simplified and exaggerated version of her position (algebra being completely useless). The responder is not engaging with the specific issue of choosing between statistics and algebra but rather attacking a distorted version of Ms. Thompson's idea about the value of algebra.","The text argues that Ms. Thompson thinks algebra is useless because she would let students take statistics instead. However, Ms. Thompson only claimed that students should be allowed to take statistics instead of algebra. She did not suggest that algebra is a useless subject. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against",0.1195307446471676,0.0471544246108153,0.3037974638551514,0.1595744680851064,12

C. John's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.

Explanation:
To determine if John inherited a trait, we need to consider whether the trait is genetic and passed down from his parents. In this case, the trait in question is ""hazel eyes."" 

- **Option A**: ""John wears glasses and so do his sisters.""
  - This statement does not provide any information about the inheritance of eye color or any other genetic trait. It only mentions that John and his sisters wear glasses, which is unrelated to the inheritance of eye color.

- **Option B**: ""John's friend also has hazel eyes.""
  - This statement indicates that John's friend has the same eye color as John, but it does not provide any information about the inheritance of the trait. It could be due to shared environmental factors or simply coincidence.

- **Option C**: ""John's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.""
  - This statement suggests that John's father has hazel eyes, which implies that John might have inherited the gene for hazel eyes from his father. The fact that his father wears contacts in his eyes does not negate the possibility that he has the genetic predisposition for hazel eyes, which can be expressed through contacts.

Therefore, the information that supports the conclusion that John inherited the trait of having hazel eyes is that his biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes, indicating that John likely has the genetic predisposition for hazel eyes.","John's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.

Explanation: The four smallest planets in the solar system are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. According to the table, all four of these planets are primarily composed of rock. Therefore, the statement that ""Of the four smallest planets, two are made mainly of gas"" is false.","To decide which four planets are the smallest, look at the volumes and compare the exponents. The volumes of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars have the smallest exponents. So, these four planets are the smallest.
These four planets are made mainly of rock. So, of the four smallest planets, none are made mainly of gas.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.

erosion caused by wind
ice melting in a cup","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.",3,3,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is:

D. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- **Erosion caused by wind** is a physical change because it involves the movement of particles (wind) that physically remove material from one place to another without altering the chemical composition of the materials involved. Wind erosion does not create new substances or alter the molecular structure of the materials being eroded.
  
- **Ice melting in a cup** is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid state to a liquid state due to an increase in temperature, but the chemical composition of water remains the same. The process does not involve the formation of new substances.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions that would result in the creation or destruction of new substances, which is the definition of a physical change. Therefore, the correct answer is D.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions that would result in the creation or destruction of new substances, which is the definition of a physical change. Therefore, the correct answer is D.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Ice melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water.
The links between atoms in the water molecules do not change. So, a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Ice melting is caused by heating. But erosion caused by wind is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0915311254692765,0.016823942351315,0.2767857094965721,0.2666666666666666,7

What is the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body? Choose the most likely ratio.,"1:3
4:0
0:4
2:2
3:1",1,-1,,"The correct answer is E. 3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are heterozygous (Bb), meaning they each have one dominant allele (B) for a normal-sized body and one recessive allele (b) for a dwarf body. When two heterozygous parents (Bb x Bb) are crossed, the possible genotypes of their offspring can be predicted using the Punnett square:

- BB (normal-sized body): 1/4
- Bb (normal-sized body): 2/4
- bb (dwarf body): 1/4

The ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body (BB + Bb) to those with a dwarf body (bb) is 3:1. This is because there are three possible combinations that result in a normal-sized body (BB or Bb) and only one combination that results in a dwarf body (bb). Therefore, the most likely ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 3:1.",,"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

Which statement describes the mango's motion?,"The mango has a constant velocity.
The mango is accelerating.",0,1,The mango is accelerating.,"The correct answer is:

B. The mango is accelerating.

Explanation:
When the mango is hanging motionless from a branch, it means that it is not moving in any direction (neither horizontally nor vertically). In physics, when an object is at rest or moving with a constant velocity, its acceleration is zero because there is no change in its velocity over time. However, if we consider the forces acting on the mango, such as gravity pulling it downward and the tension in the branch pulling it upward, these forces are balanced, resulting in a net force of zero. This balance of forces means that the mango is not accelerating; it is in a state of equilibrium.

Therefore, the correct description of the mango's motion is that it is not accelerating but rather in a state of equilibrium due to the forces being balanced.","The mango is accelerating.

"According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?","The gas pedal is pulling on Nicole's foot.
The gas pedal is pushing on Nicole's foot.",1,1,The gas pedal is pushing on Nicole's foot.,"The correct answer is:

B. The gas pedal is pushing on Nicole's foot.

Explanation:
Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if one object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal but opposite force back on the first object.

In this scenario, Nicole's foot is applying a force (the action) by pushing on the gas pedal. According to Newton's third law, the gas pedal must also be exerting an equal and opposite force back on Nicole's foot.

B. Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?

This question aligns with the experimental setup described in the passage. Jeanette's experiment involves comparing the performance of a circuit with a piece of copper versus a piece of iron. The goal is to observe if there is a difference in the brightness of the light bulb (which could be interpreted as how long the light stays lit) between the two types of conductors. The passage mentions that Jeanette observed the brightness of the light for five seconds after replacing the copper with iron and repeated the test with multiple circuits. This indicates that the primary focus of her experiment is to determine which conductor (copper or iron) allows the circuit to maintain its brightness (or equivalently, how long the light stays lit).","Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for the whisker type trait in Syrian hamsters has two alleles: H (for straight whiskers) and h (for curved whiskers). Since Minnie has straight whiskers and the allele H is associated with straight whiskers, it means that Minnie must have at least one H allele. Additionally, since Minnie has two alleles for straight whiskers, both alleles must be H. Therefore, Minnie's genotype is HH, which corresponds to the phenotype of straight whiskers.","straight whiskers.

Minnie's observable version of the whisker type trait is straight whiskers. So, Minnie's phenotype for the whisker type trait is straight whiskers.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

A. Last winter, Dale took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.

Explanation: The word ""ironic"" is traditionally used to describe a situation where there is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens, often with a humorous or unexpected twist. In this context, Dale was trying to escape the cold and snowy weather in Boston by going to Florida, but instead, Florida experienced a rare snowstorm. This creates a humorous contrast because Dale's attempt to avoid the weather led him to experience it unexpectedly, which aligns with the traditional use of the term ""ironic.""

In option B, the word ""ironic"" is not used in its traditional sense. Instead, it is used more colloquially to describe a situation where something unexpected occurs, but without the humorous or unexpected twist that is central to the traditional definition of irony. Here, Dale just missed his college friends who were already in Florida, which is an unexpected event but does not create the same humorous contrast as in option A.","Last winter, Dale took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather.

B. The supply went down.

Explanation:
When several countries in the Middle East decided to pump less oil from their oil wells in the 1970s, it directly impacted the global supply of crude oil. Since oil is often made into gasoline, a reduction in the supply of crude oil would lead to a corresponding decrease in the supply of gasoline. This decision by Middle Eastern countries, which were significant producers of oil, resulted in a reduction in the overall supply of crude oil available globally. Consequently, the supply of gasoline, which is derived from crude oil, also decreased as a result.","The supply went down.

"Based on this information, what is Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait?","not having a graying coat
having a graying coat",0,0,not having a graying coat,"The correct answer is A. not having a graying coat.

Explanation:
The passage states that the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles: G (dominant) and g (recessive). The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means that if an individual has at least one G allele, they will express the graying coat phenotype. Conversely, if an individual has only the recessive allele g (gg), they will not express the graying coat phenotype.

Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg, which means she has two copies of the recessive allele g. Since the recessive allele g is for not having a graying coat, Dolly does not have a graying coat. Therefore, her phenotype for the coat graying trait is ""not having a graying coat.""","not having a graying coat.

Explanation:
The passage states that the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles: G (dominant) and g (recessive). The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means that if an individual has at least one G allele, they will express the graying coat phenotype. Conversely, if an individual has only the recessive allele g (gg), they will not express the graying coat phenotype.

Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg, which means she has two copies of the recessive allele g. Since the recessive allele g is for not having a graying coat, Dolly does not have a graying coat. Therefore, her phenotype for the coat graying trait is ""not having a graying coat.""","Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene is gg. Dolly's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for not having a graying coat. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dolly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
Dolly's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0231356178717046,0.0118932717593976,0.3661971790112192,0.203125,8

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?,"The manager put the antique vases on these tables to show that they are reserved.
To show that these tables are reserved, the manager put the antique vases on them.",0,0,The manager put the antique vases on these tables to show that they are reserved.,"The correct answer is A. ""The manager put the antique vases on these tables to show that they are reserved.""

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" in the phrase ""to show that they are reserved"" does not clearly refer to either ""the antique vases"" or ""these tables."" This creates a vague pronoun reference because it is not immediately clear which of the two entities the pronoun is intended to modify.

In contrast, option B is clearer:

""To show that these tables are reserved, the manager put the antique vases on them.""

Here, the pronoun ""them"" clearly refers back to ""the antique vases,"" making the sentence less ambiguous.","""The manager put the antique vases on these tables to show that they are reserved.""

This creates a vague pronoun reference because it is not immediately clear which of the two entities the pronoun is intended to modify.

In contrast, option B is clearer:

""To show that these tables are reserved, the manager put the antique vases on them.""

Here, the pronoun ""them"" clearly refers back to ""the antique vases,"" making the sentence less ambiguous.","The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun they could refer to the vases or the tables.
The manager put the antique vases on these tables to show that they are reserved.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
To show that these tables are reserved, the manager put the antique vases on them.

When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

"Based on this information, what is Algernon's genotype for the fur color gene?","brown fur
ff",1,1,ff,"The correct answer is B. ff.

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which includes all the genes it possesses. For the fur color gene in rabbits, there are two alleles: F (for black fur) and f (for brown fur). Since Algernon has brown fur and the allele f is associated with brown fur, Algernon must have two copies of the brown fur allele (ff).

Here’s the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Identify the alleles**: The allele F is for black fur, and the allele f is for brown fur.
2. **Determine Algernon's fur color**: Algernon has brown fur.
3. **Determine the genotype based on the phenotype**: Since the allele f is for brown fur and Algernon has brown fur, Algernon must have at least one f allele. However, since the question states that Algernon has two alleles for brown fur, both alleles must be f.

Therefore, Algernon's genotype is ff.","ff.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?

Explanation: The statement ""Three-quarters of the planets are larger than Earth"" is false. According to the table, there are 8 planets in total. Out of these, only Jupiter and Saturn have volumes larger than Earth's volume (1.08 x 10^12 km³). This means that less than three-quarters of the planets are larger than Earth.","To decide which planets are larger than Earth, look at the volumes of the other planets and compare the exponents to the exponent of Earth's volume. Earth's volume is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3. Earth's volume is the only volume with an exponent of 12.
The volumes of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have exponents greater than 12, so these four planets are larger than Earth. There are eight planets total. So, one-half of the planets are larger than Earth.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:

The image shows a rock that appears to be scoria, characterized by its dark color and pitted surface, which is typical of this volcanic rock.","The properties of scoria match the properties of a rock. So, scoria is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

What is the probability that a Syrian hamster produced by this cross will have long fur?,"2/4
3/4
4/4
1/4
0/4",0,-1,,"The correct answer is E. 0/4.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, the alleles for fur length in the parents are F (dominant for long fur) and f (recessive for short fur). The Punnett square shows the following combinations:

- Ff (top left)
- Ff (top right)
- ff (bottom left)
- ff (bottom right)

Since the allele for short fur (f) is recessive, only the combination ""ff"" results in short fur. All other combinations (Ff and ff) result in long fur because the dominant allele (F) masks the effect of the recessive allele (f).

Therefore, none of the offspring will have short fur, which means the probability of producing a Syrian hamster with long fur is 0/4.",,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if one object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal but opposite force back on the first object.

In this scenario:
- The fridge magnet is pulling on the paper clip (action).
- According to Newton's third law, the paper clip must be pulling back on the fridge magnet with an equal and opposite force (reaction).

Therefore, the correct answer is A: The paper clip is pulling on the fridge magnet.","The paper clip is pulling on the fridge magnet.

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which is represented by the combination of alleles it possesses at a particular locus (position on a chromosome). For the body feather color gene in budgerigars, there are two alleles: B (green body feathers) and b (blue body feathers).

Since Gale has blue body feathers and the allele b is responsible for blue body feathers, we can deduce that Gale must have two copies of the b allele because having only one copy would result in a mix of both colors or no visible effect if the dominant allele B were present. Therefore, Gale's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb.","bb.

So, Gale's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

The nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.
An interrogative sentence is a question, and it always ends with a question mark.
Do you have any plans for the upcoming weekend?
An imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something, and it usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.
For this assignment, use references to support your claims.

Here, Susan's experiment involves adding worms to some compost bins (the experimental group) and not adding worms to others (the control group). The purpose of the control group is to provide a baseline for comparison to see if the addition of worms affects the decomposition rate.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.1448605831448114,0.0313144431345207,0.2758620645840666,0.238095238095238,7
"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
The volume of Mars is more than ten times as large as Mercury's.","true
false",1,0,true,"A. true

Explanation: To determine if the statement is true, we need to compare the volumes of Mars and Mercury. The volume of Mars is given as 1.63 x 10^11 km³, and the volume of Mercury is 6.08 x 10^10 km³. 

To check if Mars's volume is more than ten times larger than Mercury's, we can divide the volume of Mars by the volume of Mercury:

(1.63 x 10^11 km³) / (6.08 x 10^10 km³) ≈ 2.69

Since 2.69 is greater than 10, the volume of Mars is indeed more than ten times as large as Mercury's. Therefore, the statement is true.","true

Since 2.69 is greater than 10, the volume of Mars is indeed more than ten times as large as Mercury's. Therefore, the statement is true.","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3, which is less than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Mars is less than ten times as large as Mercury's.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)

"What do these two changes have in common?
making paper from wood
roasting a marshmallow over a campfire","Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.",1,1,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Making paper from wood** involves several chemical processes, such as pulping (breaking down wood fibers into pulp) and cooking (cooking the pulp to separate fibers), which are chemical reactions that alter the structure of the wood. The end product, paper, is not the same as the starting material, wood, indicating a chemical change.

- **Roasting a marshmallow over a campfire** also involves a chemical process. When marshmallows are roasted, they undergo a process called caramelization, where sugars in the marshmallow break down and react with other compounds, leading to the formation of new substances like melanoidins, which give the marshmallow its characteristic brown color and sweet flavor. This is a chemical change because the original marshmallow is transformed into a different substance.

Both activities involve chemical changes rather than just physical changes or cooling. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.","Both are chemical changes.

This is a chemical change because the original marshmallow is transformed into a different substance.

Both activities involve chemical changes rather than just physical changes or cooling. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Making paper from wood is a chemical change. Paper is made by mixing tiny pieces of wood with special chemicals. The wood reacts with the chemicals to form pulp. Wood and pulp are different types of matter.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Roasting is caused by heating. But making paper from wood is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

Assume all other forces on the slice of pizza are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the slice of pizza?,"The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the slice of pizza.
The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza.",1,0,"The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the slice of pizza.","The correct answer is:

A. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the slice of pizza.

Explanation:
To determine whether the forces on the slice of pizza are balanced or unbalanced, we need to compare the magnitudes of the forces acting on it. In this scenario, Quinn is pulling the slice of pizza to the left with a force of 50N, and Brad is pulling the slice of pizza to the right with a force of 45N. 

Since the forces are in opposite directions (one to the left and one to the right), we can consider them as vectors. When comparing their magnitudes, the force of 50N (from Quinn) is greater than the force of 45N (from Brad). However, for the forces to be considered unbalanced, the forces must not only be in opposite directions but also have different magnitudes such that the resultant force is not zero.

In this case, since the forces are in opposite directions but Quinn's force is greater, the net force on the slice of pizza is directed to the left by the difference in magnitude (50N - 45N = 5N). This means there is a net force of 5N to the left, indicating that the forces are unbalanced.

However, the hint provided states that ""all other forces on the slice of pizza are balanced."" This implies that any additional forces (such as friction, air resistance, etc.) are negligible or balanced out, leaving us to focus solely on the two forces Quinn and Brad are applying.

Given this context, if we assume that the forces Quinn and Brad are applying are the only significant forces and they are in opposite directions with Quinn's force being slightly stronger, then the forces are indeed unbalanced, resulting in a net force to the left.

Therefore, the correct answer based on the given information and the hint is:

B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza.","The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the slice of pizza.

dew appearing on grass in the morning","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Ice melting in a cup**: This is a physical change because ice (solid water) turns into liquid water without any change in its chemical composition. The process involves heat energy, but it does not involve the formation of new substances or the breaking down of existing ones.

- **Dew appearing on grass in the morning**: This is also a physical change. Dew forms when water vapor in the air condenses onto surfaces like grass, forming tiny droplets of liquid water. This process occurs due to the cooling of the air, which causes the water vapor to change from a gas to a liquid without altering the chemical properties of the water.

Both processes do not involve the creation or destruction of new substances, making them physical changes rather than chemical changes. Therefore, option C is the correct choice.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes do not involve the creation or destruction of new substances, making them physical changes rather than chemical changes. Therefore, option C is the correct choice.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Ice melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water.
The links between atoms in the water molecules do not change. So, a different type of matter is not formed.
Dew appearing on grass in the morning is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air touches the cool grass and becomes liquid.
The water vapor changes state to become dew, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Ice melting is caused by heating. But dew appearing on grass is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Dew appears when water vapor in the air condenses into a liquid on the grass. This is caused by cooling. But ice melting is not.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

Which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles?,"neither; their concentrations are the same

Solution B",1,1,Solution A,"B. Solution A

Explanation: Concentration refers to the amount of solute (blue particles) dissolved in a given amount of solvent (the liquid in which the solute is dissolved). In Solution A, there are more blue particles (solutes) in the same volume of solvent compared to Solution B. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.","Solution A

Explanation: Concentration refers to the amount of solute (blue particles) dissolved in a given amount of solvent (the liquid in which the solute is dissolved). In Solution A, there are more blue particles (solutes) in the same volume of solvent compared to Solution B. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.","In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter.

"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The wind () dispersed the leaves that Evan had spent so long raking.","lightly

Explanation: Personification is a literary device where human characteristics are attributed to non-human entities. In this context, we want to give the wind human-like qualities. The phrase ""carelessly"" implies that the wind is not being careful or thoughtful in its actions, which can be attributed to a person. Therefore, saying ""The wind carelessly dispersed the leaves"" gives the wind a human-like quality of not being mindful of the effort Evan put into raking the leaves. 

Option A, ""lightly,"" does not convey the same level of human-like behavior as ""carelessly."" It simply describes how the wind moved the leaves without implying any lack of consideration for Evan's work. Thus, ""carelessly"" is the more fitting choice for personification in this sentence.","carelessly.

Explanation: 
To determine what Connor and Maura can trade to each get what they want, we need to look at the items they both want but do not have in their lunches. 

- Connor wants a hot dog (which he doesn't have) and tomatoes (which he doesn't have).
- Maura wants a sandwich (which she doesn't have) and oranges (which she doesn't have).

However, there is no direct match between the items they both want. Therefore, we need to consider the items they both have but don't want:

- Connor has water, which he doesn't want.
- Maura has water, which she doesn't want.

Since they both have water but don't want it, they can trade their water with each other. This way, Connor gets Maura's water, and Maura gets Connor's water. However, this does not solve their original problem of getting the items they want.

Looking at the options provided, none of them directly address the items they want. But if we consider the closest match, option D suggests trading almonds for tomatoes. Since almonds and tomatoes are different items, this trade would not solve either person's problem of getting the items they want. 

Given the information and the options provided, the most logical trade based on the items they have and want is not explicitly listed. However, if we were to choose the closest option, it would be:

D. Maura can trade her almonds for Connor's tomatoes.

This is because almonds and tomatoes are the only items that are listed as options for trade, even though it does not solve their original problem of getting the items they want.","Maura can trade her almonds for Connor's tomatoes.

The supply probably went down.",0,0,The supply probably went up.,"The correct answer is:

A. The supply probably went up.

Explanation:
When more people move out of a city, it typically means that there are fewer residents who might be looking for homes to buy or rent. This reduction in demand can lead to an increase in the supply of houses for sale because the remaining residents may not need as many houses as before, and the houses they do need might be available at lower prices due to reduced competition from potential buyers. Therefore, the supply of houses for sale in Oak Grove likely increased as a result of the 8,000 people moving away.","The supply probably went up.

Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down

Since Solution B has more green particles per unit volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration of green particles.","Solution B

Explanation: Concentration refers to the amount of solute (green particles) dissolved in a given amount of solvent (blue liquid). In Solution A, there are 8 green particles in 40 mL of solvent, while in Solution B, there are 12 green particles in 40 mL of solvent. Since Solution B has more green particles per unit volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration of green particles.","In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

Haliaeetus pelagicus is in the genus Haliaeetus. The first word of its scientific name is Haliaeetus. So, Haliaeetus pelagicus and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

- Option B, ""Rodrigo's friend showed him how to ride a bicycle,"" indicates that someone else taught Rodrigo how to ride a bicycle, which could be a plausible way for Rodrigo to acquire this skill.
- Option C, ""Rodrigo rides his bicycle to school,"" directly supports the conclusion that Rodrigo has the ability to ride a bicycle because he is using it as a means of transportation. This shows that Rodrigo has indeed acquired the skill of riding a bicycle.

Therefore, option C provides the most direct support for the conclusion that Rodrigo has acquired the trait of being able to ride a bicycle.","Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show?

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

B. The supply probably went down.

Explanation:
The number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Fairview has decreased from seven to three. This reduction in the number of stores typically indicates that fewer suppliers are available to meet the demand for men's shirts. When the number of suppliers decreases, it generally leads to a decrease in the overall supply of the product (in this case, men's shirts) because each supplier may not be able to produce or distribute as much as before due to reduced competition and possibly increased costs associated with operating fewer stores. Therefore, the supply of men's shirts in Fairview likely went down.","The supply probably went down.

An elementary substance, on the other hand, is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means; examples include elements like hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon. Since sodium iodide is made up of two distinct elements, it fits the definition of a compound rather than an elementary substance.","You can tell whether sodium iodide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for sodium iodide, NaI, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and I for iodine. So, the formula tells you that sodium iodide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since sodium iodide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium iodide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom.

Explanation:
The statement ""Don't ever get a ride from Mia. Her brother has been driving for only six months, and he's already gotten three speeding tickets."" uses guilt by association. This fallacy occurs when a person is judged negatively based on the actions of another person they are associated with, even if there is no direct evidence linking the two. In this case, the speaker is trying to discredit Mia by associating her with her brother's poor driving record, despite not having any direct evidence that Mia herself is a bad driver. The focus is on the brother's behavior rather than on Mia's own driving habits or abilities.","The text argues that Mia must be a reckless driver, because her brother is a reckless driver. However, even though Mia's brother is reckless, that doesn't necessarily mean that Mia is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against",0.1290787266416312,0.0260743860322365,0.2572614060680774,0.1348314606741573,8

water evaporating from a puddle
dust settling out of the air","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.",3,3,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is:

D. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- **Water evaporating from a puddle** is a physical change because it involves the transition of water from its liquid state to its gaseous (vapor) state without altering its chemical composition. The molecules of water simply move faster due to increased kinetic energy, which is a result of heating (evaporation requires heat energy).
  
- **Dust settling out of the air** is also a physical change. It occurs when dust particles, which are solid matter, are no longer suspended in the air due to gravity or other forces. This process does not involve any chemical reaction; it's merely a rearrangement of the particles' positions in space.

Both processes do not involve the formation of new substances with different properties (which would be a chemical change). Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes do not involve the formation of new substances with different properties (which would be a chemical change). Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

The average kinetic energy of a particle is given by the equation \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is its speed. Since the average particle speed (\( v \)) is the same for both samples (1,100 m/s), we can compare the kinetic energies by looking at the masses of the particles.

- For Sample A, each particle has a mass of 30 u.
- For Sample B, each particle has a mass of 46 u.

Since the speed is the same for all particles in both samples, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Therefore, the particles in Sample B, with a greater mass, will have a higher average kinetic energy compared to those in Sample A.

Because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, Sample B, with the higher average kinetic energy, will have the higher temperature.","sample B

- FF (black fur)
- Ff (black fur)
- Ff (black fur)

- FF (black fur)
- Ff (black fur)
- Ff (black fur)
- ff (brown fur)

From the Punnett square, we can see that there are three possible outcomes for black fur (FF and Ff) and one outcome for brown fur (ff). Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to those with brown fur is 3:1.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.
Black fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with black fur for every 1 offspring with brown fur.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

Explanation:
The passage states that the gene for the wing type trait in fruit flies has two alleles: N (normal wings) and n (vestigial wings). The question specifies that the fruit fly in question has vestigial wings and that it has two alleles for vestigial wings. Since the allele for vestigial wings is represented by 'n', having two alleles for vestigial wings means the genotype is nn.

The question specifies that the fruit fly in question has vestigial wings and that it has two alleles for vestigial wings. Since the allele for vestigial wings is represented by 'n', having two alleles for vestigial wings means the genotype is nn.

The fruit fly has two alleles for vestigial wings (n). So, the fly's genotype for the wing type gene is nn.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Explanation: In the context of the question, we need to identify which usage of ""terribly"" aligns with its traditional sense, which typically means ""extremely"" or ""very.""

- In option A, ""She prepared them according to the recipe but found the chewy texture terribly disappointing."" The word ""terribly"" is used here to mean ""extremely disappointing,"" which fits the traditional sense of the word as an intensifier of disappointment.

- In option B, ""Candice decided to make escargots using the small snails from her garden, but she prepared them terribly. Since she'd forgotten to add garlic, the taste was disappointing."" Here, ""terribly"" is used more ambiguously and could be interpreted as a general description of how she prepared the escargots rather than intensifying the disappointment. It's less clear whether it's meant to emphasize the disappointment or just describe the preparation process.

Therefore, option A correctly uses ""terribly"" in its traditional sense as an intensifier of disappointment.","Explanation: In the context of the question, we need to identify which usage of ""terribly"" aligns with its traditional sense, which typically means ""extremely"" or ""very.""

In both Solution A and Solution B, there are 9 green particles each in a solvent volume of 45 mL. Therefore, the concentration of green particles in both solutions is the same.","In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

This is because the control group serves as a baseline for comparison against the experimental group. The experimental group, in this case, would be the sections of the wall that were only scrubbed with water (the water-only control).

For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.

Which sentence states a fact?,"Morocco is a country on the northwest coast of Africa.
Morocco is the most exciting country to visit.",0,0,Morocco is a country on the northwest coast of Africa.,"The correct answer is:

A. Morocco is a country on the northwest coast of Africa.

Explanation: 
A statement that is a fact provides information that can be proven true or false based on evidence. In this case, ""Morocco is a country on the northwest coast of Africa"" is a factual statement because it can be verified through geographical data and maps. It is a declarative statement that describes a specific location and status of Morocco without any subjective judgment or opinion.

On the other hand, ""Morocco is the most exciting country to visit"" is an opinion or subjective statement. The term ""most exciting"" is subjective as it depends on personal preferences and experiences, making it impossible to prove true or false for everyone. Therefore, it does not qualify as a fact.","Morocco is a country on the northwest coast of Africa.

Does the humidity level where tomato seeds are planted affect the number of tomato seedlings that grow?",0,0,Do more tomato seedlings grow when they are planted in soil with fertilizer compared to soil without fertilizer?,"The question that Maggie's experiment can best answer is:

A. Do more tomato seedlings grow when they are planted in soil with fertilizer compared to soil without fertilizer?

This is because Maggie's experiment specifically compares the number of tomato seedlings that grow in soil with fertilizer to those that grow in soil without fertilizer. The other factors (temperature, amount of light, and humidity) were controlled to ensure that any differences in the number of seedlings could be attributed to the presence or absence of fertilizer.","Do more tomato seedlings grow when they are planted in soil with fertilizer compared to soil without fertilizer?

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

The only arrow pointing from the grizzly bear leads to the mushroom. No arrows point from the mushroom to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the grizzly bear to the earthworm.There is one path matter can take from the parasitic jaeger to the earthworm: parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk->earthworm.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",2.2180943324172503e-05,2.7282805177871013e-06,0.2388059671140566,0.1395348837209302,7

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
sample A
neither; the samples have the same temperature",0,0,sample B,"A. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average particle speed is the same for both samples (1,600 m/s), we need to consider the mass of the particles to determine which sample has the higher average kinetic energy.

The formula for kinetic energy (KE) is given by:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is the velocity (speed) of the particle.

For Sample A, the mass of each particle is 28 u and the average speed is 1,600 m/s. Therefore, the average kinetic energy for a particle in Sample A is:

\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \, \text{u} \times (1,600 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B, the mass of each particle is 34 u and the average speed is also 1,600 m/s. Therefore, the average kinetic energy for a particle in Sample B is:

\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 34 \, \text{u} \times (1,600 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the speed \( v \) is the same for both samples, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Thus, the particle in Sample B, with a greater mass, will have a higher kinetic energy than the particle in Sample A.

Therefore, Sample B has the higher average kinetic energy and thus the higher temperature.","sample B

"Based on this information, what is Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait?","light fur
dark fur",1,0,light fur,"The correct answer is A. light fur.

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup). The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means that if an individual has at least one dominant allele (F), they will express the trait associated with that allele.

Ringo has the heterozygous genotype Ff. In this case, he has one dominant allele (F) and one recessive allele (f). Since the dominant allele (F) is present, Ringo will express the trait associated with it, which is dark fur. However, because Ringo also has the recessive allele (f), he can still show some traits related to the recessive allele under certain conditions, but in this context, we are focusing on the dominant trait.

Therefore, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait is light fur, as the dominant allele (F) is not expressed in the presence of the recessive allele (f) in a heterozygous state.","light fur.

Ringo has the heterozygous genotype Ff. In this case, he has one dominant allele (F) and one recessive allele (f). Since the dominant allele (F) is present, Ringo will express the trait associated with it, which is dark fur. However, because Ringo also has the recessive allele (f), he can still show some traits related to the recessive allele under certain conditions, but in this context, we are focusing on the dominant trait.

Therefore, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait is light fur, as the dominant allele (F) is not expressed in the presence of the recessive allele (f) in a heterozygous state.","You need to determine Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Ringo's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be dark fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0569020996027802,0.0214288198365434,0.3749999953336806,0.203125,7

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A
sample B",2,2,sample B,"C. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is its velocity, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 28 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 760 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 46 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 960 m/s

Calculating the kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \, \text{u} \times (760 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (960 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, but the average speed of the particles in Sample B is also greater, we need to consider both factors. The kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the square of the speed. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher because the increase in speed squared will dominate over the decrease in mass.

Thus, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.0380000586544862,0.0011100554514674,0.2517482471592743,0.0909090909090909,8
"What do these two changes have in common?
mixing chocolate syrup into milk
stapling an envelope shut","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.",3,3,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is:

D. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- Mixing chocolate syrup into milk involves physically combining two substances without altering their chemical composition. The properties of the mixture (like taste, texture) change, but the molecules of chocolate syrup and milk remain the same.
- Stapling an envelope shut is also a physical action. It involves applying pressure to fasten the envelope, which changes its shape and structure but does not alter the chemical makeup of the materials involved.

Both actions described do not involve any chemical reactions that would change the fundamental nature of the substances involved. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

- Mixing chocolate syrup into milk involves physically combining two substances without altering their chemical composition. The properties of the mixture (like taste, texture) change, but the molecules of chocolate syrup and milk remain the same.
- Stapling an envelope shut is also a physical action. It involves applying pressure to fasten the envelope, which changes its shape and structure but does not alter the chemical makeup of the materials involved.

Both actions described do not involve any chemical reactions that would change the fundamental nature of the substances involved. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. Making a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope and the staple get new shapes. Both are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0454931708927074,0.014784818306535,0.3203883448581394,0.2333333333333333,8

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.2036245817172849,0.0537441062269744,0.367647054395545,0.3255813953488372,8

Therefore, ammonium nitrate is a reactant in this chemical reaction.","reactant.

Explanation: In the given passage, it is stated that ""Nitrous oxide is made in factories by carefully heating ammonium nitrate."" This indicates that ammonium nitrate undergoes a chemical change to produce nitrous oxide. In a chemical reaction, the substance that undergoes a change to form new substances is called a reactant. Therefore, ammonium nitrate is a reactant in this chemical reaction.","Read the underlined text carefully. Look for information about what happens to ammonium nitrate in this chemical reaction.
To help relieve pain during a dental visit, a dentist may give a patient nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is made in factories by carefully heating ammonium nitrate. At 170°C, ammonium nitrate breaks down and forms a mixture of nitrous oxide gas and water vapor. After the mixture is collected, the water vapor is separated from the nitrous oxide gas.
The underlined text tells you that when ammonium nitrate breaks down, nitrous oxide and water are formed. When ammonium nitrate reacts, or goes through a chemical change, its atoms are rearranged to form nitrous oxide and water. Because ammonium nitrate reacts in this chemical reaction, ammonium nitrate is a reactant.

A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction.
In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.
The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.
The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, all the offspring (FF) are homozygous dominant for the fruit taste gene. This means that none of the offspring are homozygous recessive (ff). Since there are no recessive alleles present in the parents or the offspring, the probability of producing a homozygous recessive (ff) muskmelon plant is 0/4, which simplifies to 0%.","1/4.

Since there are no recessive alleles present in the parents or the offspring, the probability of producing a homozygous recessive (ff) muskmelon plant is 0/4, which simplifies to 0%.","Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0048163027747034,0.0008414041746205,0.2822085850156197,0.2,8

Therefore, the sea urchin is the primary consumer in this food web.","Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The black rockfish has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton. The zooplankton is not a producer. So, the black rockfish is not a primary consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is not a primary consumer.
The orca has an arrow pointing to it from the sea otter. The sea otter is not a producer. So, the orca is not a primary consumer.
The sea urchin has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is a producer, so the sea urchin is a primary consumer.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is a producer, so the kelp bass is a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.

Explanation: Concentration is defined as the amount of solute (blue particles) in a given amount of solvent (the liquid in which the solute is dissolved). In Solution A, there are more blue particles (solutes) in the same volume of solvent compared to Solution B. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.","Solution A

Explanation: Concentration is defined as the amount of solute (blue particles) in a given amount of solvent (the liquid in which the solute is dissolved). In Solution A, there are more blue particles (solutes) in the same volume of solvent compared to Solution B. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.","In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.

It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes

"Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait?","bush growth
climbing growth",1,1,climbing growth,"The correct answer is B. climbing growth.

Explanation:
The passage provides information about the genetic basis of the growth pattern trait in rose plants. It states that there are two alleles for this trait: \( G \) (climbing growth) and \( g \) (bush growth). The allele for bush growth (\( g \)) is recessive, meaning it only expresses itself when both alleles are \( g \) (homozygous recessive, \( gg \)). The allele for climbing growth (\( G \)) is dominant over \( g \).

The question specifies that a certain rose plant has the homozygous genotype \( GG \). Since \( G \) is the dominant allele, the presence of two \( G \) alleles means that the plant will express the dominant trait, which is climbing growth.

Therefore, the phenotype for the growth pattern trait in this rose plant is climbing growth.","climbing growth.

Explanation:
The passage provides information about the genetic basis of the growth pattern trait in rose plants. It states that there are two alleles for this trait: \( G \) (climbing growth) and \( g \) (bush growth). The allele for bush growth (\( g \)) is recessive, meaning it only expresses itself when both alleles are \( g \) (homozygous recessive, \( gg \)). The allele for climbing growth (\( G \)) is dominant over \( g \).

The question specifies that a certain rose plant has the homozygous genotype \( GG \). Since \( G \) is the dominant allele, the presence of two \( G \) alleles means that the plant will express the dominant trait, which is climbing growth.

Therefore, the phenotype for the growth pattern trait in this rose plant is climbing growth.","The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is GG. The rose plant's genotype of GG has only G allelles. The G allele is for climbing growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of GG has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0236489163947273,0.0062183858072432,0.3274336240093194,0.2272727272727272,8

You can see from the model that silicon carbide is composed of carbon atoms and silicon atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that silicon carbide is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and silicon. Since silicon carbide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silicon carbide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.

Here's why:

- **Supplies Available**: Sidney has seeds from one type of sunflower, soil, two wooden planter boxes (one in the sun and one in the shade), one plastic planter box in the sun, water.
  
- **Experiment Design**: To investigate the effect of sunlight on sunflower growth, Sidney needs to have different conditions for the sunflowers to grow under.

4:0
0:4
1:3
2:2",2,0,3:1,"The correct answer is A. 3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are heterozygous (Dd), meaning they each have one dominant allele (D) for green pods and one recessive allele (d) for yellow pods. When two heterozygous parents (Dd x Dd) are crossed, the possible genotypes of their offspring can be predicted using the Punnett square:

- DD (green pods): 1/4
- Dd (green pods): 2/4
- dd (yellow pods): 1/4

Since the allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive, only the offspring with the genotype dd will have yellow pods. All other genotypes (DD and Dd) will result in green pods. Therefore, the ratio of offspring with yellow pods (dd) to those with green pods (DD or Dd) is 1:3. This corresponds to option A.","3:1.

- dd (yellow pods): 1/4

Since the allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive, only the offspring with the genotype dd will have yellow pods. All other genotypes (DD and Dd) will result in green pods. Therefore, the ratio of offspring with yellow pods (dd) to those with green pods (DD or Dd) is 1:3. This corresponds to option A.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.
Yellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.
Green pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0461055716719036,0.011349674955172,0.3301886746729263,0.2352941176470588,8

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which includes all the genes it possesses. For the fruit taste gene in muskmelons, there are two alleles: F (for sour fruit) and f (for sweet fruit).

Given that the plant in question has sweet fruit, we know that it must carry at least one allele for sweet fruit (f). Since the problem states that the plant has two alleles for sweet fruit, both alleles must be f. Therefore, the genotype of this muskmelon plant is ff.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.1394005018137545,0.049933953766845,0.3259259214814815,0.3333333333333333,8

C. Does vegetable oil separate faster when stirred together with cold water or with hot water?

**Explanation:**

Keith's observation is that the oil and vinegar separate after a few minutes. This suggests that he might be interested in understanding the effect of temperature on the separation rate of two immiscible liquids (like oil and vinegar). The supplies he has include three glass bottles, olive oil, vegetable oil, vinegar, and both cold and hot water.

Given these supplies, Keith can set up an experiment to test the effect of temperature on the separation rate of vegetable oil and water. By using the three glass bottles, he can fill each bottle with a mixture of vegetable oil and water at different temperatures (one with cold water, one with hot water, and one as a control with room temperature water).

This setup allows him to observe and measure the time it takes for the oil and water to separate in each bottle. If the oil separates faster in one bottle compared to another, it would indicate that temperature affects the separation rate.

The other options do not align well with the supplies Keith has:
- Option A involves vinegar and water, but Keith does not have any water.
- Option B involves olive oil and coconut oil, which are not among his supplies.

In this case, the guide words given are ""bike"" and ""bridge."" This means that the words on the page will start with letters between 'b' and 'i'. The word ""boulder"" starts with the letter 'b', which falls within this range. Therefore, it would be possible to find ""boulder"" on a page where the guide words are ""bike"" and ""bridge.""

However, the question asks if ""boulder"" would be found on a dictionary page with these guide words, and the answer is ""no"" because the guide words suggest that the page contains words starting with letters from 'b' to 'i', but not including 'boulder' specifically. It's important to note that the guide words do not guarantee the presence of every word starting with those letters, only that some words starting with those letters will be present.","no.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the person is misrepresenting their father's position by suggesting that the father wants them to spend less time with friends. The father actually asked for help around the house, which does not necessarily imply a desire to reduce social time. The person is creating a simplified, exaggerated version of the father's request (the straw man) to make it easier to argue against it. This misrepresentation distorts the original statement and makes it seem like the father is against spending time with friends when the actual request was about helping around the house.","Straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:

ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Bullseye's observable version of the fur color trait is brown fur. So, Bullseye's phenotype for the fur color trait is brown fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A",0,0,sample B,"A. sample B

Explanation: The average kinetic energy of a particle in a gas is given by the equation \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is its speed. Since the average particle speed (\( v \)) is the same for both samples (1,300 m/s), we can compare the kinetic energies by looking at the masses of the particles.

- For Sample A, each particle has a mass of 40 u.
- For Sample B, each particle has a mass of 44 u.

Since the speed is the same for all particles in both samples, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Therefore, the particles in Sample B, which have a greater mass, will have a higher average kinetic energy compared to those in Sample A.

The temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the particles in Sample B have a higher average kinetic energy, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

"What do these two changes have in common?
bleaching clothes
a piece of apple turning brown","Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Bleaching clothes**: This process involves the use of chemicals to remove stains or color from fabric. The chemicals used in bleaching can cause a chemical reaction that alters the structure of the fabric, making it lighter in color. This is a chemical change because the original substance (the fabric) undergoes a transformation into a new substance with different properties.

- **A piece of apple turning brown**: This is a classic example of enzymatic browning, which occurs when an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase (also known as tyrosinase) catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds in the apple. This reaction produces melanin-like pigments, causing the apple to turn brown. This is also a chemical change because the original substance (the apple) undergoes a chemical reaction leading to the formation of new substances (brown pigments).

Both processes involve chemical reactions that result in the formation of new substances with different properties, hence they are both classified as chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

This is also a chemical change because the original substance (the apple) undergoes a chemical reaction leading to the formation of new substances (brown pigments).

Both processes involve chemical reactions that result in the formation of new substances with different properties, hence they are both classified as chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Bleaching clothes is a chemical change. The bleach reacts with dark stains on the clothes. The reaction changes the stains into different types of matter that wash away easily.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0993200596501557,0.0190033235458112,0.2184873901136926,0.1538461538461538,7

A. Is the pet lizard more active when its tank is heated with one heating lamp or with two heating lamps?

Here’s the reasoning:

- Steve has a pet lizard and observes that its activity level varies.

  - One pet lizard
  - Live crickets
  - Live mealworms
  - One heating lamp

Given these supplies, the most feasible experiment Steve can conduct is to test the effect of temperature on the lizard's activity level. This is because the heating lamp provides a variable (temperature) that can be manipulated to observe changes in the lizard's behavior.

Options B and C involve feeding the lizard different types of food (crickets, mealworms, or insects vs. lettuce). However, since Steve does not have multiple lizards to compare their activities under different feeding conditions, and he doesn't have any additional supplies like lettuce, these options cannot be investigated with the given resources.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.1043617983821027,0.0518041917820551,0.2919707986680164,0.2439024390243902,7

""The citizens of Oakland have elected several competent city council members, but the mayor's office has prevented them from significantly influencing policy.""

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""them"" does not clearly refer to any specific noun or group that the reader can easily identify as the intended subject. The sentence structure makes it ambiguous whether ""them"" refers to the citizens of Oakland who elected the city council members or the city council members themselves.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

"Complete the statement. Assume that Sanjay's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Sanjay and Earth () as he hiked toward the summit.","decreased
stayed the same
increased",2,2,increased,"The correct answer is C. increased.

Explanation: Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. It depends on the mass of the object and the height above a reference point, typically the ground. The formula for gravitational potential energy is:

\[ \text{GPE} = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the object,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( h \) is the height above the reference point.

In this scenario, Sanjay's mass (\( m \)) did not change, so we can ignore it in our analysis since it remains constant. The key factor here is the height (\( h \)). As Sanjay hiked toward the summit, his height above the ground increased. Since the gravitational force (\( g \)) is constant near the surface of the Earth, the increase in height directly leads to an increase in gravitational potential energy.

Therefore, as Sanjay hiked toward the summit, the gravitational potential energy stored between him and the Earth increased.","increased.

Since the gravitational force (\( g \)) is constant near the surface of the Earth, the increase in height directly leads to an increase in gravitational potential energy.

Therefore, as Sanjay hiked toward the summit, the gravitational potential energy stored between him and the Earth increased.","Think about how the distance between Sanjay and the center of Earth changed.
The summit of the mountain was higher than the point where Sanjay started hiking. As he hiked toward the summit, the distance between Sanjay and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Sanjay and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

"Based on this information, what is Chirpie's phenotype for the body feather color trait?","blue body feathers
green body feathers",1,0,blue body feathers,"The correct answer is A. blue body feathers.

Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Genotype and Alleles**: Chirpie has the heterozygous genotype Bb for the body feather color gene. This means that Chirpie has one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b).

2. **Dominance and Recessiveness**: The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means that for an individual to have green body feathers, they must have at least one dominant allele (B). If an individual has only the recessive allele (b), they will express the recessive trait, which in this case is blue body feathers.

3. **Phenotype Determination**: Since Chirpie has the genotype Bb, it has one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b). The presence of the dominant allele (B) means that Chirpie will express the dominant trait, which is green body feathers. However, because the question asks for the phenotype based on the given information and the hint provided, we need to consider the recessive trait when there is only one recessive allele present.

Given that Chirpie has the genotype Bb, it does not have two dominant alleles (BB) or two recessive alleles (bb). Therefore, the recessive trait (blue body feathers) is expressed when there is only one recessive allele (b) present.

Thus, Chirpie's phenotype for the body feather color trait is blue body feathers.","blue body feathers.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

Explanation: The average kinetic energy of a particle in a gas is given by the equation \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is its speed. Since both samples have the same average particle speed (\( 630 \, \text{m/s} \)), the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles.

In Sample A, each particle has a mass of \( 44 \, \text{u} \), while in Sample B, each particle has a mass of \( 26 \, \text{u} \). Therefore, the particles in Sample A have more kinetic energy on average than those in Sample B because their masses are greater.

A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other.

Explanation:
The text states, ""I read that people with higher-paying jobs wear more expensive clothing. So, if I wear fancier clothes, I'll finally get that raise I've been wanting."" This statement assumes that wearing fancier clothes (the cause) will lead to getting a raise (the effect). However, there is no direct causal relationship established between wearing more expensive clothing and receiving a raise. Wearing fancy clothes might be associated with having a higher-paying job, but it does not necessarily mean that wearing fancy clothes causes a raise. The assumption here is that because these two things occur together, one must be the cause of the other, which is a classic example of false causation.","false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:

Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of ethane is composed of six hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that ethane is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and carbon. Since ethane is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, ethane is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.

Jada's neighbor has green eyes.
Jada and her biological father wear sunglasses when they go outside.",0,0,Jada has green eyes like her biological mother.,"The correct answer is:

A. Jada has green eyes like her biological mother.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Jada inherited a trait. In this context, the trait in question is having green eyes. The hint provided states that Jada has green eyes. To determine if she inherited this trait, we need to look at who she received it from genetically.

- **Choice A**: This choice indicates that Jada has green eyes similar to her biological mother. If Jada's mother also has green eyes, it suggests that Jada could have inherited the gene for green eyes from her mother. This is a strong indicator that Jada inherited the trait from her mother.

- **Choice B**: This choice mentions that Jada's neighbor has green eyes. While this might be true, it does not provide any genetic information about Jada or her family. It simply states an observation about someone else, which is not relevant to determining Jada's genetic inheritance.

- **Choice C**: This choice mentions that Jada and her biological father wear sunglasses when they go outside. This information is about their behavior and does not provide any genetic information about Jada's eye color.

Therefore, the most relevant and supportive information for the conclusion that Jada inherited the trait of having green eyes is Choice A.","Jada has green eyes like her biological mother.

"Based on this information, what is this Channel catfish's genotype for the body color gene?","Bb
a brown body",0,0,Bb,"The correct answer is A. Bb.

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which is represented by the combination of alleles it possesses at a given locus (position on a chromosome). For the body color gene in Channel catfish, there are two alleles: B (brown body) and b (white body).

The hint states that the catfish in question has a brown body and has one allele for a brown body (B) and one allele for a white body (b). This means the catfish has the genotype Bb.

To break it down further:
- B represents the dominant allele for a brown body.
- b represents the recessive allele for a white body.
- Since the catfish has a brown body, the B allele must be dominant over the b allele.

Therefore, the genotype Bb indicates that the catfish has one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b), resulting in a brown body phenotype.","Bb.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A",2,2,sample A,"The correct answer is C. sample A.

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle can be calculated using the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is its velocity.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 46 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 880 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 40 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 680 m/s

Let's calculate the average kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (880 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \, \text{u} \times (680 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, but the average speed of the particles in Sample A is also greater, we need to compare these values to determine which sample has the higher average kinetic energy.

The kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the square of the speed. Since the speed difference between the two samples is significant (880 m/s vs. 680 m/s), the higher speed in Sample A will contribute more to the kinetic energy despite the lower mass compared to Sample B.

Therefore, Sample A has the higher average kinetic energy and thus the higher temperature.","sample A.

"What do these two changes have in common?
baking cookies
a piece of avocado turning brown","Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.",2,2,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Baking cookies** involves a series of chemical reactions, such as the Maillard reaction, where sugars and amino acids combine to form new compounds that give the cookies their characteristic flavor and color. Additionally, baking powder or yeast can cause a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, which makes the dough rise.

- **A piece of avocado turning brown** is also a chemical change. This occurs due to oxidation, where the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (also known as tyrosinase) catalyzes the conversion of phenolic compounds into quinones, which then react with oxygen to form melanins, causing the browning effect.

Both processes involve chemical reactions that result in new substances being formed, which is the definition of a chemical change. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

Both processes involve chemical reactions that result in new substances being formed, which is the definition of a chemical change. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies!
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0622191074139478,0.0117500886205951,0.2403433428097774,0.2295081967213114,8

Explanation: In this sentence, ""them"" is a vague pronoun reference because it does not clearly indicate which specific branches Ariel requested to be removed. The sentence could be interpreted as Ariel requesting a permit for any branches that had grown over the power lines, or it could be interpreted as Ariel specifically requesting a permit for the branches that she herself had grown over the power lines. To avoid ambiguity, the sentence should specify which branches were being referred to. A clearer version would be:

A. Since the branches had grown over the power lines, Ariel requested a permit to have those branches removed.

This version uses ""those"" to clearly refer back to the branches that had grown over the power lines, thus eliminating the vagueness in the pronoun reference.","The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun they could refer to the branches or the power lines.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. They has been replaced with the branches.

"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Earth's volume is more than ten times as great as Mars's volume.","false
true",0,1,true,"B. true

Explanation: To determine if Earth's volume is more than ten times as great as Mars's volume, we need to compare the two volumes:

- Earth's volume is \(1.08 \times 10^{12}\) km³.
- Mars's volume is \(1.63 \times 10^{11}\) km³.

We can calculate how many times greater Earth's volume is compared to Mars's by dividing Earth's volume by Mars's volume:

\[
\frac{1.08 \times 10^{12}}{1.63 \times 10^{11}} = \frac{1.08}{1.63} \times 10^{12-11} = 0.662 \times 10^1 = 6.62
\]

Since 6.62 is more than 10, Earth's volume is indeed more than ten times as great as Mars's volume. Therefore, the statement is true.","true

\]

Since 6.62 is more than 10, Earth's volume is indeed more than ten times as great as Mars's volume. Therefore, the statement is true.","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^12 km^3. So, Earth's volume is less than ten times as great as Mars's volume.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.1111063401857479,0.0326747941541429,0.2588235248442907,0.1842105263157894,8

Explanation: When Billy rode the escalator from the first floor to the second floor of a shopping mall, his height above the ground increased. According to the law of conservation of energy, the gravitational potential energy (PE) of an object is given by the formula:

\[ PE = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the ground).

Since Billy's mass (\( m \)) did not change, and the acceleration due to gravity (\( g \)) remains constant on Earth, the only variable that changed was his height (\( h \)). As he moved from the first floor to the second floor, his height above the ground increased, which means his gravitational potential energy also increased.

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Billy and Earth increased as he rode the escalator.","increased.

As he moved from the first floor to the second floor, his height above the ground increased, which means his gravitational potential energy also increased.

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Billy and Earth increased as he rode the escalator.","Think about how the distance between Billy and the center of Earth changed.
The second floor is higher than the first floor. As he rode the escalator toward the second floor, the distance between Billy and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Billy and Earth increased as he rode the escalator.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample A

neither; the samples have the same temperature",1,1,sample B,"B. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average particle speed is the same for both samples (1,100 m/s), we need to consider the mass of the particles to determine which sample has the higher average kinetic energy.

The formula for kinetic energy (KE) is given by:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is the velocity (speed) of the particle.

Given that the average particle speed (\( v \)) is the same for both samples (1,100 m/s), the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles.

- Sample A has particles with a mass of 28 u.
- Sample B has particles with a mass of 32 u.

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A, the particles in Sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy.

Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature because it contains particles with a higher average kinetic energy.","sample B

Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.

"Based on this information, what is Undyne's phenotype for the Bekko patterning trait?","not having Bekko patterning
having Bekko patterning",1,1,having Bekko patterning,"The correct answer is B. Having Bekko patterning.

Explanation:
The passage states that the gene for the Bekko patterning trait has two alleles: \( B \) (for having Bekko patterning) and \( b \) (for not having Bekko patterning). It also mentions that the allele for not having Bekko patterning (\( b \)) is recessive to the allele for having Bekko patterning (\( B \)).

Since Undyne has the homozygous genotype \( BB \), both alleles are \( B \). In genetics, when an organism has two dominant alleles (\( BB \)), it will express the dominant phenotype. Therefore, Undyne, with the genotype \( BB \), will have the phenotype of having Bekko patterning.","Having Bekko patterning.

Therefore, Undyne, with the genotype \( BB \), will have the phenotype of having Bekko patterning.","Undyne's genotype for the Bekko patterning gene is BB. Undyne's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for having Bekko patterning. So, Undyne's phenotype for the Bekko patterning trait must be having Bekko patterning.
To check this answer, consider whether Undyne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having Bekko patterning (b) is recessive to the allele for having Bekko patterning (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Undyne's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Undyne's phenotype for the Bekko patterning trait must be having Bekko patterning.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0081175046773801,0.0030907147790568,0.3317535505159363,0.21875,8

"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The rising tide () the sandcastle that the children had so carefully crafted.","washed over

A. washed over

Explanation: Personification is a literary device where human characteristics are attributed to non-human entities. In this context, we want to describe the rising tide in a way that gives it human-like actions.

- ""Washed over"" is a form of personification because it attributes the action of washing (a human activity) to the tide, giving it a gentle, flowing motion as if it were a person washing something.

- ""Gobbled up"" does not fit the context well for personification here. While it could be used metaphorically, it doesn't have the same smooth, flowing quality that would make it a good choice for personifying the tide in this scenario. It might imply a more aggressive or devouring action, which doesn't align with the careful crafting of the sandcastle by the children.

**B. Does a rubber inner tube sled or a plastic sled go faster down a hill?**

Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Access to a small snow-covered hill**: This provides the necessary environment for sledding.
2. **A small plastic sled and a large plastic sled**: These are both plastic sleds, so they are not suitable for comparing different materials directly.

Which statement describes the Steigerwald Forest ecosystem?,"It has soil that is rich in nutrients.
It has a small amount of rain or snow.
It has soil that is poor in nutrients.",0,2,It has soil that is poor in nutrients.,"The correct answer is:

C. It has soil that is poor in nutrients.

Explanation: Temperate deciduous forests like the Steigerwald Forest typically have soil that is relatively poor in nutrients. This is because the rapid growth of trees and the shedding of leaves lead to a high demand for nutrients, which are quickly taken up by the plants. Additionally, the decomposition of organic matter can be slow due to the cold winters, leading to a buildup of organic material on the forest floor rather than its being fully incorporated into the soil. This results in nutrient-poor soil conditions over time.","It has soil that is poor in nutrients.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A
sample B",1,1,sample A,"B. sample A

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle can be calculated using the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is its velocity.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (m_A) = 36 u
- Average particle speed (v_A) = 1,600 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (m_B) = 17 u
- Average particle speed (v_B) = 1,400 m/s

Let's calculate the average kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = 0.5 \times 36 \, \text{u} \times (1600 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = 0.5 \times 17 \, \text{u} \times (1400 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, and the average speed of the particles in Sample A is also greater than the average speed of the particles in Sample B, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A will be higher. Therefore, Sample A has the higher temperature.","sample A

"Based on this information, what is Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait?","light fur
dark fur",0,1,dark fur,"The correct answer is:

B. dark fur

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup). The allele for light fur (f) is recessive, meaning that it only expresses itself when both copies of the gene are f (homozygous recessive). The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant.

Given that Cleo has the homozygous genotype ff, she has two copies of the recessive allele for light fur. Since the recessive allele is expressed in the presence of two copies, Cleo will exhibit the phenotype associated with the recessive allele, which is light fur. However, since the question asks for the phenotype based on the given information and the hint provided, we can infer that the recessive allele (f) results in light fur, and the dominant allele (F) results in dark fur.

Given that Cleo has the homozygous genotype ff, she has two copies of the recessive allele for light fur. Since the recessive allele is expressed in the presence of two copies, Cleo will exhibit the phenotype associated with the recessive allele, which is light fur. However, since the question asks for the phenotype based on the given information and the hint provided, we can infer that the recessive allele (f) results in light fur, and the dominant allele (F) results in dark fur.

Therefore, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait is light fur.","Cleo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Cleo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Cleo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Cleo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0373800928164785,0.0101490994103133,0.3433476348740997,0.2063492063492063,7

"Based on this information, what is Wishbone's genotype for the fur length gene?","FF
short fur",0,0,FF,"The correct answer is A. FF.

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which is represented by the combination of alleles it possesses at a particular locus (position on a chromosome). For the fur length gene in this scenario:

- The allele \( F \) is dominant and results in short fur.
- The allele \( f \) is recessive and results in long fur.

Since Wishbone has short fur and the allele \( F \) is dominant over \( f \), Wishbone must have two copies of the dominant allele \( F \) to express the phenotype of short fur. Therefore, Wishbone's genotype for the fur length gene is \( FF \).

Option B, ""short fur,"" does not represent a genotype but rather the phenotype (the observable characteristic) that Wishbone exhibits.","FF.

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which is represented by the combination of alleles it possesses at a particular locus (position on a chromosome). For the fur length gene in this scenario:

- The allele \( F \) is dominant and results in short fur.
- The allele \( f \) is recessive and results in long fur.

Since Wishbone has short fur and the allele \( F \) is dominant over \( f \), Wishbone must have two copies of the dominant allele \( F \) to express the phenotype of short fur. Therefore, Wishbone's genotype for the fur length gene is \( FF \).

Option B, ""short fur,"" does not represent a genotype but rather the phenotype (the observable characteristic) that Wishbone exhibits.","An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Wishbone has two alleles for short fur (F). So, Wishbone's genotype for the fur length gene is FF.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.",0.2321871258140779,0.0589007206290521,0.3798882632389751,0.2888888888888888,7

This is evident from the text provided in the question, which states that the organism in the picture is a European hedgehog and gives its scientific name as Erinaceus europaeus. Therefore, the correct choice is A. Erinaceus europaeus.","A European hedgehog's scientific name is Erinaceus europaeus. The first word of its scientific name is Erinaceus.
Caprimulgus europaeus and Erinaceus europaeus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Caprimulgus europaeus and Erinaceus europaeus have the same species name within their genus, europaeus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Caprimulgus europaeus is in the genus Caprimulgus, and Erinaceus europaeus is in the genus Erinaceus.
Equus zebra is in the genus Equus. The first word of its scientific name is Equus. So, Equus zebra and Erinaceus europaeus are not in the same genus.
This organism and the European hedgehog are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Erinaceus europaeus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?,"Tyler worked with Dave to design the new header for Dave's website.
Tyler worked with Dave to design the new header for his website.",1,1,Tyler worked with Dave to design the new header for his website.,"The correct answer is B. ""Tyler worked with Dave to design the new header for his website.""

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" does not clearly refer to either ""Tyler"" or ""Dave."" It could be interpreted as referring to either person, which makes it ambiguous and thus a vague pronoun reference. To avoid this ambiguity, one should specify who ""his"" refers to, such as by using ""Tyler's"" or ""Dave's"" instead.

When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:

In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed.

Which statement describes the Steigerwald Forest ecosystem?,"It has soil that is poor in nutrients.
It has soil that is rich in nutrients.",1,0,It has soil that is poor in nutrients.,"A. It has soil that is poor in nutrients.

Explanation: Temperate deciduous forests like the Steigerwald Forest typically have soil that is relatively poor in nutrients. This is because the rapid decomposition of leaves and other organic matter by decomposers (such as fungi and bacteria) can lead to nutrient cycling within the forest floor. However, the nutrients are often quickly taken up by the roots of the trees, which can lead to a depletion of nutrients in the soil over time. Additionally, the frequent leaf fall and the presence of a thick layer of leaf litter on the forest floor can contribute to the poor nutrient content of the soil.","It has soil that is poor in nutrients.

Mitochondria break down sugar to release energy that an animal cell can use.",2,2,Mitochondria break down sugar to release energy that an animal cell can use.,"The correct answer is:

C. Mitochondria break down sugar to release energy that an animal cell can use.

Explanation:

- **A. Plant cells can have vacuoles but do not have mitochondria.** This statement is false. Plant cells, like all eukaryotic cells, contain both vacuoles and mitochondria. Vacuoles are large organelles that store substances such as water, nutrients, and waste products, while mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell where cellular respiration occurs, breaking down sugars to release energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

- **B. Mitochondria direct cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of a plant cell.** This statement is also false. Mitochondria are involved in cellular respiration, which is the process of breaking down glucose to produce energy. They do not directly send instructions to other parts of the cell; rather, they are part of the cell's machinery that works alongside other organelles and the cytoplasm to carry out various functions. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, directing activities through the DNA it contains.

- **C. Mitochondria break down sugar to release energy that an animal cell can use.** This statement is true. Mitochondria are indeed responsible for breaking down glucose and other organic molecules through a series of chemical reactions called cellular respiration. These reactions release energy in the form of ATP, which is the primary energy currency used by cells to perform their functions.

saliva breaking down a piece of bread","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Rust forming on a metal gate**: This is a chemical change because rust (iron oxide) is formed through a chemical reaction between iron, oxygen, and water. The iron metal is oxidized to form iron oxide, which is rust. This process involves the formation of new chemical compounds.

- **Saliva breaking down a piece of bread**: This is also a chemical change. Saliva contains enzymes that break down carbohydrates in food, such as starches found in bread, into simpler sugars like glucose. This process is known as hydrolysis, where water molecules break down the complex carbohydrates into simpler forms. This is a chemical reaction involving the breakdown of existing molecules into different ones.

Both processes involve the transformation of substances into new substances with different properties, which is characteristic of chemical changes. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

This is a chemical reaction involving the breakdown of existing molecules into different ones.

Both processes involve the transformation of substances into new substances with different properties, which is characteristic of chemical changes. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.
The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0894335971891192,0.0222877558021452,0.2959641208019466,0.2666666666666666,7

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample A

neither; the samples have the same temperature",1,0,sample A,"A. sample A

The average kinetic energy of a particle is given by the equation \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is its speed. Since the average particle speed (\( v \)) is the same for both samples (1,000 m/s), we can compare the kinetic energies by looking at the masses of the particles.

- For Sample A, each particle has a mass of 32 u.
- For Sample B, each particle has a mass of 40 u.

Since the speed is the same, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Therefore, the particles in Sample B have more kinetic energy than those in Sample A because they are heavier.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since the particles in Sample B have a higher average kinetic energy, Sample B has a higher temperature.","sample A

"Based on this information, what is Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait?","not having agouti fur
having agouti fur",1,1,having agouti fur,"The correct answer is B. Having agouti fur.

Explanation:
- The gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles: A (dominant) and a (recessive).
- The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a).
- Nabi has the homozygous genotype AA for the agouti fur gene.
- Since Nabi has two dominant alleles (AA), they will express the dominant trait, which is having agouti fur.

Therefore, based on the information provided, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait is having agouti fur.","Having agouti fur.

Explanation:
- The gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles: A (dominant) and a (recessive).
- The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a).
- Nabi has the homozygous genotype AA for the agouti fur gene.
- Since Nabi has two dominant alleles (AA), they will express the dominant trait, which is having agouti fur.

Therefore, based on the information provided, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait is having agouti fur.","Nabi's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA. Nabi's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for having agouti fur. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nabi's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Nabi's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0024102866205055,0.0013859508760882,0.2959183638093503,0.1875,8

"What do these two changes have in common?
burning a candle
deep-frying chicken","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.",1,1,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Burning a candle** involves a chemical reaction where the wax (a hydrocarbon) reacts with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat energy. This process is known as combustion, which is a type of chemical change.

- **Deep-frying chicken** also involves a chemical change. The oil used for frying reacts with the chicken's surface, causing it to brown and become crispy due to the Maillard reaction, a complex series of chemical reactions that occur when amino acids and reducing sugars react at high temperatures. This results in the formation of new compounds and flavors.

Both processes involve chemical reactions that transform the materials involved into different substances, making them chemical changes rather than physical changes. Physical changes, on the other hand, involve changes in state or form without altering the chemical composition of the substance. For example, melting a candle would be a physical change because the wax changes from solid to liquid but remains the same substance.","Both are chemical changes.

For example, melting a candle would be a physical change because the wax changes from solid to liquid but remains the same substance.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.148267968716203,0.0329799956370787,0.2999999950125001,0.293103448275862,8

"What is the temperature of the air on a cold, rainy day?","42°C
42°F",1,1,42°F,"The correct answer is B. 42°F.

Explanation: The Celsius scale (°C) and the Fahrenheit scale (°F) are both used to measure temperature, but they have different scales. A common reference point for comparing these two scales is that 0°C is equivalent to 32°F, and 100°C is equivalent to 212°F. 

Given the options:

- Option A: 42°C
- Option B: 42°F

To determine which is more likely to be the temperature of the air on a cold, rainy day, we need to convert 42°C to Fahrenheit using the conversion formula:

\[ \text{°F} = \left( \frac{9}{5} \times \text{°C} \right) + 32 \]

Plugging in 42°C:

\[ \text{°F} = \left( \frac{9}{5} \times 42 \right) + 32 \]
\[ \text{°F} = \left( 75.6 \right) + 32 \]
\[ \text{°F} = 107.6 \]

So, 42°C is approximately 107.6°F. This is a very warm temperature, not typical for a cold, rainy day. On a cold, rainy day, temperatures are usually much lower than this. For example, a typical cold, rainy day might be around 42°F or even slightly below.

Which of the following could Hector's test show?,"whether the filter was clogged
the amount of bacteria in the water before it was filtered
whether an inexpensive filter would become clogged more often",0,0,whether the filter was clogged,"The correct answer is A. whether the filter was clogged.

Explanation: In the context provided, Hector is inspecting a water treatment plant where an expensive filter is used to remove disease-causing bacteria from the water. The filter becomes clogged over time, which affects its efficiency. By measuring how quickly water moves through the filter, Hector can determine if the filter is still effective or if it has become too clogged. This measurement helps him decide when the filter needs to be replaced to ensure that the water continues to be treated properly and efficiently. Therefore, Hector's test shows whether the filter is clogged, as this directly impacts the water's flow rate and the effectiveness of the filtration process.","whether the filter was clogged.

We go over a few basic terms, and I introduce them to different browsers. I taught them where to find the URL for a website and how to use search boxes. We cover different ways to navigate around a website; for example, I show them how to use a mouse, how to scroll up or down a page using the scroll bar, and how to click on links. Now they are excited to be online.

During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?",0.4325419724722998,0.2780733679019159,0.4382022422265181,0.3295454545454545,11

"Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait?","fuzzy leaves
smooth leaves",1,1,smooth leaves,"The correct answer is B. smooth leaves.

Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Genotype and Alleles**: The plant in question has the homozygous genotype \(ll\). This means it has two recessive alleles for smooth leaves (l).

2. **Dominance and Recessiveness**: The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l). This means that if an individual has at least one L allele, they will express the fuzzy leaf phenotype.

3. **Phenotype Determination**: Since the plant has the genotype \(ll\) (two recessive alleles), it will express the phenotype associated with the recessive allele, which is smooth leaves.

Therefore, based on the given information, the phenotype for the leaf texture trait of this plant is smooth leaves.","smooth leaves.

3. **Phenotype Determination**: Since the plant has the genotype \(ll\) (two recessive alleles), it will express the phenotype associated with the recessive allele, which is smooth leaves.

Therefore, based on the given information, the phenotype for the leaf texture trait of this plant is smooth leaves.","The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is ll. The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for smooth leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0091562652234851,0.0025705913823608,0.3423423381641101,0.2205882352941176,8
Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample A
neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample B",1,1,neither; the samples have the same temperature,"B. neither; the samples have the same temperature

Explanation: The average kinetic energy of a particle in a gas is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. The formula for the average kinetic energy (KE) of a gas particle is given by:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is the speed of the particle.

In both Sample A and Sample B, the mass of each particle (\( m \)) is 46 u and the average particle speed (\( v \)) is 1,300 m/s. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles in both samples can be calculated as follows:

\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (1,300 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (1,300 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass and speed of the particles are the same in both samples, the average kinetic energy of the particles in both samples will also be the same. As a result, the temperature of the gases in both samples will be the same. Therefore, neither sample has a higher temperature than the other.","neither; the samples have the same temperature

Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.4166666666666667,0.1940235172256506,0.3666666621680556,0.6666666666666666,7

mixing lettuce and salad dressing","Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.

D. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- **Beating an egg**: This involves breaking the eggshell, cracking the egg, and mixing the contents (yolk and white) with other ingredients. This process does not involve any chemical reactions; it's simply the mechanical action of breaking and mixing the egg. Therefore, it is a physical change.
  
- **Mixing lettuce and salad dressing**: This involves combining the lettuce leaves with a dressing to coat them evenly. The process here is also purely mechanical, involving the distribution of the dressing over the lettuce without any chemical reaction occurring between the ingredients. Thus, this is also a physical change.

Both actions described do not involve any chemical reactions or changes in the molecular composition of the substances involved. They are solely about the arrangement and state of matter, which is characteristic of physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both actions described do not involve any chemical reactions or changes in the molecular composition of the substances involved. They are solely about the arrangement and state of matter, which is characteristic of physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0944378014187809,0.0175850255449353,0.2739725979700173,0.1694915254237288,7

The use of ""but nobody goes there anymore"" and ""it's too crowded"" together form a paradoxical statement, as it suggests that the bistro's popularity has decreased despite becoming more crowded.","The text uses a paradox, a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
Nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded at first appears to be contradictory, because if no one goes to the restaurant, then the restaurant should be empty, not crowded. However, it contains some truth: if a restaurant is frequently perceived to be too crowded, many people will no longer want to go there.

It contains oily seeds that can be transformed into sustainable biofuel.",0,1,Scientists are researching a hybrid South African tobacco plant that may decrease reliance on fossil fuels. It contains oily seeds that can be transformed into sustainable biofuel.,"The correct answer is:

**B. Scientists are researching a hybrid South African tobacco plant that may decrease reliance on fossil fuels. It contains oily seeds that can be transformed into sustainable biofuel.**

Explanation: In this sentence, ""It"" is used as a pronoun to refer back to the ""hybrid South African tobacco plant."" However, the pronoun ""It"" is vague because it does not clearly specify which ""it"" is being referred to. The sentence structure makes it unclear whether ""It"" refers to the ""plant"" or something else in the context.

In contrast, option A avoids this issue by using ""They"" instead of ""It,"" which clearly refers to the scientists who are conducting the research. This makes the sentence clearer and less prone to ambiguity.","Scientists are researching a hybrid South African tobacco plant that may decrease reliance on fossil fuels.

"What do these two changes have in common?
a copper statue turning green
firing a clay pot in a hot kiln","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.",3,3,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is D. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **A copper statue turning green**: This is a chemical change known as oxidation. When copper reacts with oxygen in the presence of moisture, it forms a green patina called copper carbonate (Cu2(OH)2CO3). This process involves a chemical reaction that alters the composition of the copper.

- **Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln**: This is also a chemical change. Clay, which is primarily composed of aluminum silicate minerals, undergoes a series of chemical reactions when heated. These reactions include the melting and recrystallization of the minerals, leading to the formation of a more stable ceramic material. The clay transforms into a different substance with new properties due to the heat.

Both processes involve chemical changes where materials are transformed into different substances with altered properties. Cooling is not a factor in either process; rather, they both require heating to initiate the chemical reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Both are chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

Cooling is not a factor in either process; rather, they both require heating to initiate the chemical reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Both are chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Firing clay is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.1283472629764387,0.0363863657209323,0.2953586448980755,0.2769230769230769,7

"Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Arlington. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Arlington?","The supply probably went up.
The supply probably went down.",1,1,The supply probably went down.,"The correct answer is:

B. The supply probably went down.

Explanation:
The number of men's clothing stores on Main Street in Arlington has decreased from seven to three. This reduction in the number of stores typically indicates that fewer suppliers are available to meet the demand for men's shirts. When the number of suppliers decreases, it generally leads to a decrease in the overall supply of the product (in this case, men's shirts) because each supplier may not be able to produce or distribute as much as before due to reduced competition and possibly increased costs associated with operating fewer stores. Therefore, the supply of men's shirts in Arlington likely went down.","The supply probably went down.

Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down

Therefore, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.","Solution B

Explanation: Concentration refers to the amount of solute (blue particles) dissolved in a given amount of solvent (the liquid in which the solute is dissolved). In this case, both solutions have the same volume of solvent (30 mL), but Solution B contains more blue particles than Solution A. Therefore, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.","In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

"According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?","The gas pedal is pushing on Samantha's foot.
The gas pedal is pulling on Samantha's foot.",0,0,The gas pedal is pushing on Samantha's foot.,"The correct answer is:

A. The gas pedal is pushing on Samantha's foot.

Explanation:
According to Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, if Samantha's foot is pushing on the gas pedal, then the gas pedal must also be pushing back on Samantha's foot with an equal but opposite force. This is because the action (foot pushing) and the reaction (pedal pushing back) are directly related and occur simultaneously. 

In this scenario, the action is Samantha's foot applying a force to the gas pedal, and the reaction is the gas pedal applying an equal and opposite force back on Samantha's foot. This interaction is crucial for the car to accelerate as the force applied by Samantha's foot is transmitted through the gas pedal to the engine, causing the car to move.","The gas pedal is pushing on Samantha's foot.

Which of the following could Shelley's test show?,"how much the drone weighed with the blade guards
if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly
if the blade guards would break in a crash",1,1,if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly,"The correct answer is B: if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly.

Explanation: In the context provided, Shelley designed a drone with blade guards to protect the propeller blades from damage during crashes. However, she also considered the weight of the blade guards as a factor because she believed that if the guards were too heavy, it would negatively impact the drone's performance. To test this hypothesis, Shelley conducted an experiment by adding lightweight metal blade guards to one drone and observing its flight performance compared to another drone without blade guards. This test aimed to determine whether the addition of the blade guards affected the drone's ability to fly effectively, which aligns with option B. Option A is incorrect because the test did not measure the weight of the drone with the blade guards; instead, it focused on the flight performance. Option C is also incorrect because the test did not involve a crash scenario; it only observed the flight performance with the blade guards in place.","if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

"What do these two changes have in common?
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas","Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.",3,3,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is D. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle**: This process involves the movement of particles due to gravity, which is a physical change. The particles (sediment) are not being transformed into a different substance; they are simply moving from one location to another based on their density and the gravitational force acting upon them.

- **Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas**: Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When it sublimes, it changes directly from a solid to a gas without passing through a liquid phase. This is also a physical change because no new substance is formed; it's just a change in state from solid to gas.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions where new substances are created or old substances are broken down. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions where new substances are created or old substances are broken down. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0765287983893372,0.0273395856429201,0.3183673421387756,0.2615384615384615,7

Assume all other forces on the ice cube are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the ice cube?,"The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the ice cube.
The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.",1,1,"The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.","The correct answer is:

B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.

Explanation:
When an ice cube is floating in a glass of water, it is in equilibrium because the forces acting on it are balanced. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. **Gravitational Force (Weight):** The Earth's gravity pulls downward on the ice cube with a force of 0.1N.
2. **Buoyant Force:** The water exerts an upward force on the ice cube equal to its weight, which is also 0.1N.

Since the gravitational force (downward) is exactly balanced by the buoyant force (upward), the net force acting on the ice cube is zero. This means that the ice cube does not accelerate; it remains stationary or moves at a constant velocity. Therefore, the forces on the ice cube are balanced, and there is no net force acting on it.","The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.

In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup). The question provides that the gene for the coat pattern trait in jaguars has two alleles: A (for a black coat) and a (for a spotted coat). The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).

Since Jupiter has the homozygous genotype AA, it means Jupiter has two copies of the dominant allele A. Because the allele A is dominant over the allele a, the presence of at least one A allele will result in the black coat phenotype.

The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).

Since Jupiter has the homozygous genotype AA, it means Jupiter has two copies of the dominant allele A. Because the allele A is dominant over the allele a, the presence of at least one A allele will result in the black coat phenotype. Therefore, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a black coat.","Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Jupiter's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for a black coat. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Jupiter's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Jupiter's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.017827968632781,0.0079427877216696,0.3761467847689589,0.2153846153846154,8
"Using only these supplies, which question can Emma investigate with an experiment?","Will eight ounces of carbonated water or eight ounces of tap water get warmer when placed in a jar in the sun?
When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?
When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?",1,1,"When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?","Given the supplies Emma has (two identical glass jars, two jar lids, tap water, a measuring cup, and two thermometers), the most appropriate experiment she can conduct is:

**B. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?**

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Identical Jars**: Emma has two identical glass jars, which allows her to compare the temperature changes under different conditions.
2. **Jar Lids**: The presence of two jar lids means she can cover one jar while leaving the other open, creating a variable for whether the jar is sealed or not.
3. **Tap Water**: The tap water provides a consistent medium for the experiment.
4. **Measuring Cup**: This ensures that both jars contain exactly eight ounces of water.
5. **Thermometers**: These allow Emma to measure the temperature of the water inside each jar over time.

By placing one jar in the sun with its lid on (closed) and the other jar in the sun with its lid off (open), Emma can investigate the effect of air circulation on the warming of the water. This setup directly addresses the question of whether the presence of air (or lack thereof) affects how quickly and to what extent the water warms up in the sun.

The other options either involve different materials (plastic cups instead of glass jars) or different quantities of water, which would make it difficult to isolate the variables effectively using the given supplies.

To determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Mars.

The volume of Jupiter is given as \(1.43 \times 10^{15} \, \text{km}^3\).
The volume of Mars is given as \(1.63 \times 10^{11} \, \text{km}^3\).

First, let's express these volumes in a comparable form:

- Jupiter's volume: \(1.43 \times 10^{15} \, \text{km}^3\)
- Mars's volume: \(1.63 \times 10^{11} \, \text{km}^3\)

Since 8790 is more than 10,000, the statement ""Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars"" is true.","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.2091786528250813,0.0687525496241723,0.2841530005733226,0.2222222222222222,8
Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
sample A
neither; the samples have the same temperature",1,1,sample A,"B. sample A

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle can be calculated using the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is its speed. 

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (m_A) = 46 u
- Average particle speed (v_A) = 700 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (m_B) = 44 u
- Average particle speed (v_B) = 630 m/s

Let's calculate the average kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = 0.5 \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (700 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = 0.5 \times 44 \, \text{u} \times (630 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than that in Sample B, but the speed of the particles in Sample A is also greater, we need to compare these values directly. However, the key point here is that the temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles.

Given that the average particle speed in Sample A is higher than in Sample B, even though the mass is slightly higher, the increased speed contributes more significantly to the kinetic energy. Therefore, Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.","sample A

B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Max.

Explanation:
When considering the forces acting on Max, we need to look at the forces that are directly affecting him. In this scenario, the only two forces mentioned are the gravitational force pulling Max downward (400N) and the upward force exerted by the diving board (400N). These two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, which means they cancel each other out.

sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
an iceberg melting slowly","Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.",1,1,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle**: This process involves the movement of particles due to gravity, which is a physical change. The particles (sediment) are not being transformed into new substances; they are simply moving from one location to another within the same state of matter (solid or liquid).

- **An iceberg melting slowly**: This is also a physical change because it involves the transition of water from its solid state (ice) to its liquid state (water). No new substance is formed; it's just a change in the state of matter.

Both processes do not involve any chemical reactions where new substances are created from the breakdown of existing ones. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

- **An iceberg melting slowly**: This is also a physical change because it involves the transition of water from its solid state (ice) to its liquid state (water). No new substance is formed; it's just a change in the state of matter.

Both processes do not involve any chemical reactions where new substances are created from the breakdown of existing ones. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
An iceberg melting is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. An iceberg is made of frozen water. As it melts, the water changes from a solid to a liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
An iceberg melting is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0571515318087195,0.0173950468608353,0.3274336236478973,0.2222222222222222,8

Therefore, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait is soft fur.","Chester's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Chester's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for soft fur. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Chester's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chester's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0038472492211005,0.0012972658346235,0.3490565996351015,0.203125,7

A. a compound

Explanation:
A compound is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together. In the case of cyclooctasulfur, its chemical formula is S₈, which indicates that it consists of eight sulfur atoms bonded together. Since it is made up of only one type of atom (sulfur), it does not meet the criteria to be classified as an elementary substance.

An elementary substance, on the other hand, is a substance consisting of only one type of atom. Examples include elements like hydrogen (H₂), oxygen (O₂), and carbon (C). Since cyclooctasulfur contains only sulfur atoms, it would be considered an elementary substance if it were not for the fact that it is a cyclic molecule with eight sulfur atoms.

Therefore, cyclooctasulfur is correctly identified as a compound because it is composed of multiple sulfur atoms bonded together, forming a single molecule.","a compound

Therefore, cyclooctasulfur is correctly identified as a compound because it is composed of multiple sulfur atoms bonded together, forming a single molecule.","You can tell whether cyclooctasulfur is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for cyclooctasulfur, S8, contains one atomic symbol: S for sulfur. So, the formula tells you that cyclooctasulfur is composed of only one chemical element.
Since cyclooctasulfur is composed of only one chemical element, cyclooctasulfur is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0735751080787855,0.0054850750008783,0.3853210961211178,0.3396226415094339,8

"What do these two changes have in common?
a puddle freezing into ice on a cold night
mixing sand and water","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.",2,2,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night**: This is a physical change because it involves a change in state from liquid to solid without altering the chemical composition of the water. The molecules simply slow down and arrange themselves in a crystalline structure, which is a physical process.

- **Mixing sand and water**: This is also a physical change because it involves combining two substances (sand and water) but does not create a new substance or alter the chemical properties of either component. The sand remains sand, and the water remains water; they just mix together.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions that would result in the formation of new substances with different properties. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions that would result in the formation of new substances with different properties. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
A puddle freezing is caused by cooling. But mixing sand and water is not.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0824091774780562,0.0227983878764812,0.3288888840888889,0.2413793103448276,8

The other options, Tigrisoma mexicanum and Ardea herodias, do not belong to the genus Falco; they are from different genera and families altogether.","A common kestrel's scientific name is Falco tinnunculus. The first word of its scientific name is Falco.
Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus.
Falco sparverius is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco sparverius and Falco tinnunculus are in the same genus.
Tigrisoma mexicanum is in the genus Tigrisoma. The first word of its scientific name is Tigrisoma. So, Tigrisoma mexicanum and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0769696588637646,0.0182747555399556,0.3453237361213188,0.2777777777777778,8

Explanation: In option A, the pronoun ""it"" in the sentence ""and it said that they often have no Internet access"" is vague because it is not clear what ""it"" refers to. The pronoun could refer to any number of things mentioned earlier in the sentence or even something outside the context provided. This lack of specificity makes the pronoun reference unclear and therefore vague.

When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:

"Complete the statement.
Potassium hydroxide is ().","a compound
an elementary substance",0,0,a compound,"The correct answer is:

A. a compound

Explanation:
Potassium hydroxide, with the chemical formula KOH, is a compound because it consists of two or more different types of atoms bonded together. Specifically, it is composed of one potassium atom (K) and one hydroxide ion (OH-). The presence of multiple elements in its structure confirms that it is not an elementary substance, which would consist of only one type of atom.

To further elaborate on why it is not an elementary substance:
- An elementary substance, also known as an element, is made up of only one type of atom. Examples include hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and carbon (C).
- Potassium hydroxide contains both potassium (K) and oxygen (O) along with hydrogen (H), making it a combination of different elements, thus qualifying it as a compound.

Therefore, the statement ""Potassium hydroxide is a compound"" is accurate.","a compound

- Potassium hydroxide contains both potassium (K) and oxygen (O) along with hydrogen (H), making it a combination of different elements, thus qualifying it as a compound.

Therefore, the statement ""Potassium hydroxide is a compound"" is accurate.","You can tell whether potassium hydroxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for potassium hydroxide, KOH, contains three atomic symbols: K for potassium, O for oxygen, and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that potassium hydroxide is composed of three chemical elements bonded together.
Since potassium hydroxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium hydroxide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0540951118097452,0.0039075330486565,0.3693693646031166,0.3333333333333333,8

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.

"Based on this information, what is Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait?","a red coat
a black coat",1,1,a black coat,"The correct answer is:

B. a black coat

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for coat color in cows has two alleles: L (black coat) and l (red coat). The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l). This means that if an animal has at least one L allele, it will express the black coat phenotype.

Moxie has the homozygous genotype LL, which means she has two copies of the dominant allele L. Since the dominant allele (L) is for a black coat, Moxie will express the black coat phenotype regardless of whether she has another L or an l allele.

Therefore, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat.","a black coat

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for coat color in cows has two alleles: L (black coat) and l (red coat). The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l). This means that if an animal has at least one L allele, it will express the black coat phenotype.

Moxie has the homozygous genotype LL, which means she has two copies of the dominant allele L. Since the dominant allele (L) is for a black coat, Moxie will express the black coat phenotype regardless of whether she has another L or an l allele.

Therefore, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat.","Moxie's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Moxie's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Moxie's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Moxie's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0134622911249913,0.0060114958557719,0.3738317716250328,0.1875,7

B. an elementary substance

Explanation:
Hydrogen is an element, which means it consists of only one type of atom. In this case, hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron. The chemical formula for hydrogen is H₂, indicating that two hydrogen atoms bond together to form a molecule.

An element cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Therefore, hydrogen is classified as an elementary substance rather than a compound. A compound, on the other hand, is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms bonded together in a fixed ratio. Examples of compounds include water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).","an elementary substance

A compound, on the other hand, is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms bonded together in a fixed ratio. Examples of compounds include water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).","You can tell whether hydrogen is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for hydrogen, H2, contains one atomic symbol: H. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element.
Since hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element, hydrogen is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0248006162238105,0.005534441803398,0.4038461491586538,0.2830188679245283,8

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which includes all the genes it possesses. For the fur type gene in this scenario, there are two alleles: F (for straight fur) and f (for curly fur). Since Precious has straight fur and the allele F is associated with straight fur, Precious must have at least one F allele.

Given that Precious has two alleles for straight fur, both alleles must be F. Therefore, Precious's genotype is FF.

**B. Do rubber balloons stick to a cotton blanket or a wooden door longer after being rubbed on his hair?**

Here's the reasoning:

- **Cody's Experiment Goal:** Cody wants to investigate what factors affect how well balloons stick to different surfaces.
- **Supplies Available:** Hair (from Cody), a cotton blanket, a wooden door, and five rubber balloons.

Given these supplies, Cody can conduct an experiment comparing the sticking ability of the balloons on two different surfaces: a cotton blanket and a wooden door. This setup allows him to test the effect of surface type on the balloon's adhesion after being rubbed on his hair.

**Why the other options are not suitable:**
- **Option A:** This option involves a comparison between two types of balloons (rubber and foil) and two different surfaces (wooden door). However, since Cody only has rubber balloons, this option cannot be investigated with the given supplies.
- **Option C:** This option involves a comparison between two different surfaces (wooden door and metal door). However, there is no metal door available in the supplies, making this option unfeasible for Cody's experiment.

Explanation: When Stefan rode his motorcycle up the hill, the height of the motorcycle relative to the ground increased. As the height increases, the gravitational potential energy (PE) stored between the motorcycle and the Earth also increases. Gravitational potential energy is given by the formula \( PE = mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the ground). Since the mass of the motorcycle did not change, the increase in height directly leads to an increase in gravitational potential energy.

The top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill. As Stefan rode toward the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased as Stefan rode up the hill.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, the alleles for horn presence (h) and absence (H) are shown. The Punnett square indicates that all four possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are Hh. Since the allele for having horns (h) is recessive, an individual must inherit two h alleles to not have horns. However, since all offspring have one H and one h allele, they will all express the trait for having horns because the dominant H allele masks the recessive h allele. Therefore, the ratio of offspring with horns to those without horns is 4:0, which simplifies to 3:1 when considering the dominance of the H allele over h.","3:1.

The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have horns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have horns.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff

Then compare the result to the volume of Uranus. The volume of Uranus is 6.83 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 6.25 x 10^14 km^3. So, the volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3

The surface of the water is higher than the point where the whale was swimming deep in the ocean.

This aligns with the traditional use of the word ""ironic.""

In option A, the phrase ""in an ironic twist"" is also used, but it describes a situation where Levi missed his college friends who were already in Florida, which is not inherently ironic as it does not involve a contrast between expectation and reality.

Explanation: The word ""ironic"" is traditionally used to describe a situation where there is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens, often with a humorous or unexpected twist. In option B, the situation described is indeed ironic because Levi went to Florida to escape the cold and snowy weather, but then a rare snowstorm hit Florida, which is unexpected and humorous given his intention. This aligns with the traditional use of the word ""ironic.""

In option A, the phrase ""in an ironic twist"" is also used, but it describes a situation where Levi missed his college friends who were already in Florida, which is not inherently ironic as it does not involve a contrast between expectation and reality. It simply describes a coincidence. Therefore, option B correctly uses the word ""ironic"" in its traditional sense.","The first text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Levi tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Levi took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The second text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Levi's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Levi took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect.

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

What is the expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat? Choose the most likely ratio.,"1:3
4:0
3:1
0:4
2:2",4,2,3:1,"The correct answer is C. 3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, the alleles for coat color are represented as L (black) and l (reddish-brown). Since the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l), any offspring that receives at least one L allele will have a black coat. 

- The top left box shows ""LI,"" which means an offspring with one L and one I allele (assuming I represents another allele not affecting coat color in this context).
- The top right box shows ""II,"" indicating an offspring with two I alleles.
- The bottom left box also shows ""LI,"" similar to the top left box.
- The bottom right box shows ""II,"" similar to the top right box.

Since all four boxes show either ""LI"" or ""II,"" it indicates that all offspring will inherit at least one L allele from each parent. Therefore, all offspring will have a black coat, resulting in a 3:1 ratio of offspring with a black coat to those with a reddish-brown coat.","3:1.

- The top right box shows ""II,"" indicating an offspring with two I alleles.
- The bottom left box also shows ""LI,"" similar to the top left box.
- The bottom right box shows ""II,"" similar to the top right box.

Since all four boxes show either ""LI"" or ""II,"" it indicates that all offspring will inherit at least one L allele from each parent. Therefore, all offspring will have a black coat, resulting in a 3:1 ratio of offspring with a black coat to those with a reddish-brown coat.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.
A reddish-brown coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a reddish-brown coat must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
A black coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the dominant version of the coat color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with a reddish-brown coat for every 2 offspring with a black coat.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1127515529374079,0.030563279308014,0.3831775653048302,0.2916666666666667,8

When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

What is the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit? Choose the most likely ratio.,"4:0
0:4
3:1
2:2
1:3",3,2,3:1,"The correct answer is C. 3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, the alleles for the fruit taste trait are represented as follows: F for the dominant allele that results in sour fruit, and f for the recessive allele that results in sweet fruit. The Punnett square shows the following combinations:

- Top left: FF (sour fruit)
- Top right: Ff (sour fruit)
- Bottom left: Ff (sour fruit)
- Bottom right: ff (sweet fruit)

From the Punnett square, we can see that there are three possible genotypes for sour fruit (FF, Ff, Ff) and one genotype for sweet fruit (ff). Since the F allele is dominant over the f allele, all the F_ genotypes will result in sour fruit, while only the ff genotype will result in sweet fruit. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 1:3.","3:1.

Since the F allele is dominant over the f allele, all the F_ genotypes will result in sour fruit, while only the ff genotype will result in sweet fruit. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 1:3.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.
Sweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Sour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with sweet fruit for every 2 offspring with sour fruit.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0826864387509759,0.0325657706912461,0.3940886652663253,0.3469387755102041,8

Explanation:
Guide words in a dictionary are used to help readers locate the correct page where a specific word begins. They appear at the top of each page, indicating the range of words that start with letters between the two guide words. In this case, the guide words are ""ravenous"" and ""rise.""

- The word ""ravenous"" starts with the letter ""r.""
- The word ""rise"" also starts with the letter ""r.""

Since both words start with the same letter, we need to determine which one comes alphabetically first. The alphabetical order for these words is:

1. ravenous (comes after ""r"" in the alphabet)
2. rise (comes before ""s"" in the alphabet)

Therefore, any word that appears on the page between ""ravenous"" and ""rise"" must start with the letter ""r"" and come alphabetically after ""ravenous."" Among the given choices:

- A. reform (starts with ""r"" but comes after ""ravenous"" alphabetically)
- B. rudder (starts with ""r"" and comes after ""ravenous"" alphabetically)

Thus, ""rudder"" is the correct word that would be found on a dictionary page with the guide words ""ravenous"" and ""rise.""","rudder.

Herman subscribed to an online newsletter about African wildlife; he enjoyed receiving daily factoids about the wild animals' natural habitats and behavior.",0,1,Herman subscribed to an online newsletter about African wildlife; he enjoyed receiving daily factoids about the wild animals' natural habitats and behavior.,"The correct answer is B.

Explanation: The term ""factoid"" traditionally refers to a piece of information that is presented as true but is actually false or misleading. It is often used to describe a fact that has been exaggerated or distorted for the purpose of making a point or creating a humorous effect. In this context, the word ""factoid"" is being used in its traditional sense to describe pieces of information that are not necessarily accurate.

In option A, the use of ""factoids"" is more aligned with its modern usage, where it describes small pieces of trivia or information that may be true but are often considered trivial or unimportant. Here, Herman's knowledge is described as being based on these small pieces of trivia, which could be either true or false, but the focus is more on the quantity rather than the accuracy of the information.

Option B, however, uses ""factoids"" in the traditional sense, referring to specific pieces of information that are presented as facts but might not be entirely accurate. This aligns with the original definition of the term, which was coined by Norman Mailer in 1973 to describe such information. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.","Explanation: The term ""factoid"" traditionally refers to a piece of information that is presented as true but is actually false or misleading.

Explanation: The statement ""Didn't you hear that his uncle was imprisoned for embezzling $1.5 million?"" is an attempt to discredit Jayce by associating him with his uncle's criminal activity. This is a form of guilt by association, where the person being evaluated is judged negatively based on the actions of someone they are associated with, rather than on their own merits.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.

"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Neptune's volume is more than 100 times as large as Earth's.","false
true",0,0,false,"A. false

Explanation: To determine if Neptune's volume is more than 100 times as large as Earth's, we need to compare their volumes.

- Neptune's volume is approximately \(6.25 \times 10^{13} \, \text{km}^3\).
- Earth's volume is approximately \(1.08 \times 10^{12} \, \text{km}^3\).

To find out how many times larger Neptune's volume is compared to Earth's, we divide Neptune's volume by Earth's volume:

\[
\frac{6.25 \times 10^{13}}{1.08 \times 10^{12}} \approx 5.79
\]

This calculation shows that Neptune's volume is approximately 5.79 times larger than Earth's volume, which is far less than 100 times larger. Therefore, the statement is false.","false

Then compare the result to the volume of Neptune. The volume of Neptune is 6.25 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 1.08 x 10^14 km^3. So, Neptune's volume is less than 100 times as large as Earth's.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0953713308288699,0.0285539901094459,0.2558139489108978,0.2105263157894736,8

"What do these two changes have in common?
snails growing shells
photosynthesis","Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.",1,1,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Snails growing shells**: This process involves the deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) from the snail's body fluids onto its shell. This is a chemical reaction where the snail's body chemistry interacts with the environment to form the shell, which is a chemical change.

- **Photosynthesis**: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. It involves the chemical reactions that take place within the plant cells, converting carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) into glucose and oxygen (O₂). This is also a chemical change.

Neither of these processes can be classified as purely physical changes because they involve chemical transformations. Heating or cooling alone does not cause these changes; rather, they are driven by biological processes and chemical reactions. Therefore, options A and C are incorrect, and option D is irrelevant since neither process is caused by cooling.","Both are chemical changes.

Therefore, options A and C are incorrect, and option D is irrelevant since neither process is caused by cooling.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Snails growing shells is a chemical change. A snail's body uses calcium from its food to make a new molecule called calcium carbonate. This calcium carbonate is used to grow the shell.
Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.1236228104895294,0.0234859994098792,0.3474576222105717,0.2769230769230769,8

Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.2134012490735539,0.0058884989501336,0.2999999950195313,0.1764705882352941,8
"What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
Caleb described the situation he was facing with his boss as a catch-22.","literature
a poem",0,0,literature,"The correct answer is:

A. literature

Explanation:
The phrase ""catch-22"" is an allusion to the novel ""Catch-22"" by Joseph Heller, which was published in 1961. The novel is a satirical work that explores themes of absurdity, bureaucracy, and the futility of war through the character of Yossarian, who is trying to avoid being sent on dangerous missions. The term ""catch-22"" refers to a paradoxical situation where the only way to escape a problem is by doing something that proves the problem exists, making it impossible to escape.

Therefore, when Caleb describes his situation with his boss as a ""catch-22,"" he is using this literary allusion to suggest that there is no way out of the problematic situation he is in, just like the protagonist in Heller's novel faces an impossible dilemma.","literature

Joseph Heller coined the term ""catch-22"" in his 1961 novel of the same name. In the novel, if an army pilot wants to avoid dangerous missions, he must be deemed mentally unfit; however, his desire to stay safe proves his sanity, so he can never be excused from a mission. Heller called this sort of predicament or dilemma a catch-22.
The allusion catch-22 means a no-win situation.

Explanation:
Mason's test involved placing a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel to simulate the conditions of the spacecraft traveling at 200 km per hour. The purpose of this test was to observe how the parachute would behave under these conditions, specifically focusing on its stability and how much it would swing. This information is crucial for ensuring that the parachute will land the spacecraft smoothly without causing any damage due to excessive swinging. The test helps in determining the appropriate size of the vent to achieve the desired level of stability at the specified speed.","how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are homozygous recessive for yellow fruit (ff). When two recessive alleles (f) combine, the offspring will also be homozygous recessive (ff), resulting in yellow fruit. Since there are no dominant alleles present, all offspring will express the recessive phenotype, which is yellow fruit.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are homozygous recessive for yellow fruit (ff). When two recessive alleles (f) combine, the offspring will also be homozygous recessive (ff), resulting in yellow fruit. Since there are no dominant alleles present, all offspring will express the recessive phenotype, which is yellow fruit. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.
Yellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
Red fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with yellow fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red fruit.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0035486060158607,0.0016748511559871,0.2727272689211003,0.2244897959183673,8

To check if Saturn's volume is more than ten times Uranus's volume, we can divide Saturn's volume by Uranus's volume:

(8.27 x 10^14) / (6.83 x 10^13) ≈ 1.21

Therefore, the statement ""The volume of Saturn is more than ten times the volume of Uranus"" is false.","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Uranus.
Then compare the result to the volume of Saturn. The volume of Saturn is 8.27 x 10^14 km^3, which is greater than 6.83 x 10^14 km^3. So, the volume of Saturn is more than ten times the volume of Uranus.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3

This leap from a minor action (blocking websites) to a major consequence (banning books and having only propaganda) is not logically sound and relies on a chain of assumptions that are not necessarily true or likely to occur.","The text argues that blocking websites will eventually lead to having only propaganda to read. However, this isn't necessarily true. This argument offers only one extreme and unlikely outcome. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the slippery slope fallacy.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.

"What does the hyperbole in this text suggest?
After he finished the marathon, Dean collapsed into a chair and declared that he could no longer move a single muscle.","Dean was very tired and sore.
Dean became paralyzed.",0,0,Dean was very tired and sore.,"The correct answer is:

A. Dean was very tired and sore.

Explanation:
The phrase ""could no longer move a single muscle"" is an example of hyperbole, which is an exaggeration used for emphasis or effect. In this context, it suggests that Dean is extremely exhausted and sore from the marathon, to the point where he feels as though he cannot move any part of his body. This is a common way people describe feeling completely drained after a strenuous physical activity like a marathon. The hyperbole exaggerates the extent of Dean's fatigue but does not imply that he has become paralyzed, which would be an extreme and unlikely outcome from a marathon run. Therefore, the hyperbole suggests that Dean is very tired and sore, not that he has become paralyzed.","Dean was very tired and sore.

"Based on this information, what is Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait?","straight fur
curly fur",0,0,straight fur,"The correct answer is A. straight fur.

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""phenotype"" refers to the observable characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup). The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive, meaning that for a cat to have curly fur, it must be homozygous for the recessive allele (ff). However, in this case, Precious has the genotype FF, which means she is homozygous for the dominant allele (F).

Since the allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for curly fur (f), any individual with at least one F allele will express the straight fur phenotype. Therefore, Precious, who has the genotype FF, will have the straight fur phenotype.","straight fur.

The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive, meaning that for a cat to have curly fur, it must be homozygous for the recessive allele (ff). However, in this case, Precious has the genotype FF, which means she is homozygous for the dominant allele (F).

Since the allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for curly fur (f), any individual with at least one F allele will express the straight fur phenotype. Therefore, Precious, who has the genotype FF, will have the straight fur phenotype.","Precious's genotype for the fur type gene is FF. Precious's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Precious's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Precious's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.011234002477136,0.0040029404239657,0.3619909458979137,0.15625,8

Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is:

C. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a physical change because it involves a change in state from liquid to solid without altering the chemical composition of the water. The molecules simply rearrange themselves as they cool down, forming ice crystals.
- Beating an egg is also a physical change. When you beat an egg, you are changing its shape and structure (breaking the shell and mixing the contents), but the chemical composition of the egg remains the same. There is no new substance formed, just a change in the form or arrangement of the existing substances.

Both processes do not involve any chemical reactions that alter the fundamental nature of the materials involved, making them both physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

paradox",1,0,oxymoron,"The correct answer is:

A. oxymoron

Explanation: An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms. In the given text, ""stay away"" and ""go in"" are not contradictory but rather indicate a warning about safety. The phrase ""oxymoron"" itself is an example of one because it combines the words ""ox"" (a type of animal) and ""moron"" (a term for someone who is foolish), which are not typically used together and create a contradiction.

The other option, ""paradox,"" refers to a statement that seems to contradict itself but may be true in a certain context. The text does not present a statement that contradicts itself; instead, it gives advice on safety. Therefore, ""oxymoron"" is the correct choice as it accurately describes the use of the term ""oxymoron"" within the text.","oxymoron

"Using only these supplies, which question can Ruben investigate with an experiment?","Do watercolor paintings dry faster when placed next to a fan?
Does a large watercolor painting or a small watercolor painting dry faster?
Do watercolor paintings dry faster when they are placed inside or outside?",2,1,Does a large watercolor painting or a small watercolor painting dry faster?,"The correct answer for Ruben's experiment is:

**B. Does a large watercolor painting or a small watercolor painting dry faster?**

Here’s the reasoning:

- **Supplies Available**: Ruben has two freshly painted watercolor pictures of the same size, a dining room table, a picnic table in his backyard, and a heater.
- **Experiment Design**: To investigate whether the size of the watercolor painting affects its drying time, Ruben needs to ensure that all other variables (such as temperature, humidity, and air circulation) remain constant except for the size of the painting.

Given the supplies, Ruben can set up two identical-sized watercolor paintings on different surfaces (e.g., the dining room table and the picnic table in the backyard). This way, he can compare the drying times of the two paintings while keeping the environment relatively similar (assuming both locations have similar temperature and humidity levels).

The other options cannot be investigated effectively with the given supplies because:
- **Option A**: The fan would need to be used to create air circulation, which is not mentioned among the supplies.
- **Option C**: The heater could potentially be used to control temperature, but it is not clear if it would be practical to use it outdoors on a picnic table, and it might not be necessary since the focus is on comparing indoor and outdoor drying times.

Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed.

Assume all other forces on the leash are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the leash?,"The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the leash.
The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the leash.",0,1,"The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the leash.","The correct answer is:

B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the leash.

Explanation:
To determine whether the forces on the leash are balanced or unbalanced, we need to consider the direction and magnitude of the forces acting on it. In this scenario, we have two forces acting on the leash:
- Daisy pulls forward on the leash with a force of 250N.
- Camilla pulls backward on the leash with a force of 180N.

Since these two forces are in opposite directions (one forward and one backward), they can be considered as opposing forces. To find the net force, we subtract the smaller force from the larger force:

Net Force = Force by Daisy - Force by Camilla
Net Force = 250N - 180N
Net Force = 70N

The net force is 70N in the direction of the force exerted by Daisy (forward). However, the question asks about the overall balance of the forces on the leash, not the net force. Since the forces are in opposite directions but not equal in magnitude, the forces are not balanced. Therefore, the correct statement is that the forces are balanced, which implies there is no net force on the leash.

Thus, the correct choice is B.","The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the leash.

Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.

Which text uses the word literally in its traditional sense?,"The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Logan's mouth was literally on fire by the time he finished his meal.
The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Logan literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.",1,1,The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Logan literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.,"The correct answer is B.

Explanation: In the context of the question, ""literally"" traditionally means ""in fact"" or ""actually,"" without any figurative meaning. This usage contrasts with the more common modern usage where ""literally"" often implies an exaggeration for emphasis, as in A.

In option A, ""Logan's mouth was literally on fire"" is an idiomatic expression used to describe extreme spiciness, not a literal statement about fire. Therefore, it does not use ""literally"" in its traditional sense.

In option B, ""literally had to drink three glasses of milk"" is a straightforward statement indicating that Logan actually drank three glasses of milk, which aligns with the traditional definition of ""literally."" Thus, this sentence uses ""literally"" in its traditional sense.","Explanation: In the context of the question, ""literally"" traditionally means ""in fact"" or ""actually,"" without any figurative meaning.

"Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the wing type trait?","normal wings
vestigial wings",0,0,normal wings,"The correct answer is A. normal wings.

Here’s the reasoning based on the provided information:

1. **Genotype and Phenotype Relationship**: The genotype of the fruit fly in question is given as Nn, which means it is heterozygous for the wing type trait. Heterozygous means that the individual has one dominant allele and one recessive allele.

2. **Dominance and Recessiveness**: The allele for normal wings (N) is dominant over the allele for vestigial wings (n). This means that if an individual has at least one N allele, they will express the normal wing phenotype.

3. **Phenotype Determination**: Since the fruit fly has the genotype Nn, it has one dominant allele (N) and one recessive allele (n). Because the dominant allele (N) is present, the fruit fly will express the dominant phenotype, which is normal wings.

Therefore, the phenotype of the fruit fly with the genotype Nn for the wing type trait is normal wings.","normal wings.

3. **Phenotype Determination**: Since the fruit fly has the genotype Nn, it has one dominant allele (N) and one recessive allele (n). Because the dominant allele (N) is present, the fruit fly will express the dominant phenotype, which is normal wings.

Therefore, the phenotype of the fruit fly with the genotype Nn for the wing type trait is normal wings.","You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the wing type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This means N is a dominant allele, and n is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Nn has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait must be normal wings.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.035993858321683,0.0130474828307232,0.336283181598794,0.2205882352941176,8
Select the part whose main job is to help a plant cell make proteins.,"cytoplasm
endoplasmic reticulum
mitochondria
cell wall",1,1,endoplasmic reticulum,"The correct answer is B. endoplasmic reticulum.

Explanation: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle in eukaryotic cells that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, modification, and transport. It is composed of a network of membranes that can be either rough or smooth depending on the presence of ribosomes attached to its surface. Rough ER has ribosomes attached to it, which helps in the synthesis of proteins, while smooth ER does not have ribosomes and is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification processes.

- **Cytoplasm**: This is the gel-like substance inside the cell where most cellular activities take place, but it does not specifically help in making proteins.
- **Mitochondria**: These are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration. They do not directly help in protein synthesis.
- **Cell Wall**: This is a rigid layer outside the cell membrane in plant cells, providing structural support and protection. It is not involved in protein synthesis.

- **Cell Wall**: This is a rigid layer outside the cell membrane in plant cells, providing structural support and protection. It is not involved in protein synthesis.

Therefore, the endoplasmic reticulum is the correct choice as it is primarily responsible for helping a plant cell make proteins.","The endoplasmic reticulum helps the cell make proteins. Instructions for making proteins are sent to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum and use the instructions to make proteins.

Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.",0.1253801602500976,0.0164365384181229,0.3333333285187929,0.2048192771084337,7

- **Chromosomes** (option B) are structures within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells that contain genetic material (DNA). They are involved in the storage and transmission of genetic information but do not directly contribute to the growth or activities of the plant cell through energy production.
  
- **Mitochondria** (option C) are known as the ""powerhouses"" of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy. While important for cellular energy production, mitochondria are more commonly associated with animal cells rather than being the primary site of energy production in plant cells.
  
- **Golgi apparatus** (option D) is involved in modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion from the cell or for use within the cell.

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for eye color in guinea pigs has two alleles: E (brown eyes) and e (red eyes). The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e). This means that if an individual has at least one E allele, they will express brown eyes. Conversely, if an individual has only the e allele (ee), they will express red eyes.

Basil is described as having the homozygous genotype ee. Since the e allele is recessive and Basil has two copies of it (ee), Basil will express the recessive phenotype, which is red eyes. Therefore, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait is red eyes.","red eyes.

Basil is described as having the homozygous genotype ee. Since the e allele is recessive and Basil has two copies of it (ee), Basil will express the recessive phenotype, which is red eyes. Therefore, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait is red eyes.","Basil's genotype for the eye color gene is ee. Basil's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for red eyes. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes.
To check this answer, consider whether Basil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Basil's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0124155577474541,0.0052421796523993,0.3944954086587829,0.2153846153846154,7

"What do these two changes have in common?
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon
a piece of avocado turning brown","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

1. **Using Polish to Remove Tarnish from a Silver Spoon**: 
   - When you use polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon, you are changing the surface of the metal. The tarnish (which is a layer of copper sulfide) is removed through a chemical reaction where the polish reacts with the tarnish, breaking it down into simpler substances. This process involves a chemical change because the composition of the tarnish is altered.

2. **A Piece of Avocado Turning Brown**:
   - When an avocado turns brown, it is undergoing a chemical change known as oxidation. This occurs when the exposed flesh of the avocado reacts with oxygen in the air, causing a chemical reaction that results in the browning of the flesh. This is a chemical change because the avocado's composition is altered by the interaction with oxygen.

Both scenarios involve chemical changes where the substances undergo reactions that alter their properties or compositions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

This is a chemical change because the avocado's composition is altered by the interaction with oxygen.

Both scenarios involve chemical changes where the substances undergo reactions that alter their properties or compositions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.1128696749303633,0.0293906399724877,0.2499999952549428,0.2058823529411764,8

13 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air
9 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air",0,2,9 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air,"The correct answer is C. 9 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.

Explanation: The map shows specific humidity levels in grams per kilogram (g/kg) across different regions. The outlined area in the image is located over a region with a specific humidity value of approximately 9 g/kg, as indicated by the color within the outlined area matching the color bar corresponding to 9 g/kg. Therefore, the specific humidity level measured within the outlined area is 9 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.","9 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.

The outlined area in the image is located over a region with a specific humidity value of approximately 9 g/kg, as indicated by the color within the outlined area matching the color bar corresponding to 9 g/kg. Therefore, the specific humidity level measured within the outlined area is 9 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.","Look at the colors shown within the outlined area. Then, use the legend to determine which specific humidity levels those colors represent.
The legend tells you that this air mass contained air with specific humidity levels between 18 and 24 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.
24 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air is within this range.
9 and 13 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air are outside of this range.

To study air masses, scientists can use maps that show conditions within Earth's atmosphere. For example, the map below uses color to show specific humidity, a measurement of the amount of water vapor in the air.
The map's legend tells you the specific humidity level that each color represents. Colors on the left in the legend represent lower specific humidity levels than colors on the right.

It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes

Explanation:
In the Punnett square provided, we can see the possible combinations of alleles when two heterozygous fruit flies (Aa) are crossed. The alleles A (mutated antennae) is dominant over a (normal antennae). 

- AA: Both alleles are dominant (mutated antennae)
- Aa: One dominant and one recessive allele (mutated antennae)
- aa: Both alleles are recessive (normal antennae)

From the Punnett square, we can see that there are three possible genotypes for offspring with mutated antennae (AA and Aa) and one genotype for offspring with normal antennae (aa).

Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae (AA + Aa) to offspring with normal antennae (aa) is 3:1.","3:1.

Explanation:
In the Punnett square provided, we can see the possible combinations of alleles when two heterozygous fruit flies (Aa) are crossed. The alleles A (mutated antennae) is dominant over a (normal antennae). 

- AA: Both alleles are dominant (mutated antennae)
- Aa: One dominant and one recessive allele (mutated antennae)
- aa: Both alleles are recessive (normal antennae)

From the Punnett square, we can see that there are three possible genotypes for offspring with mutated antennae (AA and Aa) and one genotype for offspring with normal antennae (aa).

Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae (AA + Aa) to offspring with normal antennae (aa) is 3:1.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mutated antennae or normal antennae, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for mutated antennae, is dominant over the a allele, which is for normal antennae.
Mutated antennae is the dominant allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the antenna type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with mutated antennae must have the genotype AA or Aa.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal antennae is the recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the antenna type trait must have only recessive alleles for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with normal antennae must have the genotype aa.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with mutated antennae for every 1 offspring with normal antennae.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

A. a compound

Explanation:
Potassium chloride (KCl) is a compound because it consists of two different elements, potassium (K) and chlorine (Cl), chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. In contrast, an elementary substance is composed of only one type of atom, such as oxygen (O2) or hydrogen (H2). Since potassium chloride contains both potassium and chlorine atoms, it fits the definition of a compound.","a compound

Explanation:
Potassium chloride (KCl) is a compound because it consists of two different elements, potassium (K) and chlorine (Cl), chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. In contrast, an elementary substance is composed of only one type of atom, such as oxygen (O2) or hydrogen (H2). Since potassium chloride contains both potassium and chlorine atoms, it fits the definition of a compound.","You can tell whether potassium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for potassium chloride, KCl, contains two atomic symbols: K for potassium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that potassium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since potassium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium chloride is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0014245020460965,0.0004732077685451,0.3296703257354185,0.2181818181818181,7

"Based on this information, what is Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait?","a black coat
a red coat",1,1,a red coat,"The correct answer is B. a red coat.

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup). The gene in question here controls the coat color of the cows, with the allele for a red coat (l) being recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).

Given that Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype ""ll,"" it means she has two copies of the recessive allele for a red coat. Since the allele for a red coat (l) is recessive, Cheyenne will express the phenotype associated with the red coat.

Therefore, based on her genotype ""ll,"" Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait is a red coat.","a red coat.

Therefore, based on her genotype ""ll,"" Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait is a red coat.","Cheyenne's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a red coat. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0117657712165185,0.0048836098741989,0.3240740699039781,0.203125,7
Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature

sample B",2,2,sample B,"C. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is its speed, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 28 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 780 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 32 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 940 m/s

Calculating the kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \, \text{u} \times (780 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 \, \text{u} \times (940 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the speed of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the mass of the particles in Sample B is also greater than that in Sample A, the kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

Since the speed of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the mass of the particles in Sample B is also greater than that in Sample A, the kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A",2,2,sample A,"C. sample A

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle, we can compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For both samples, the mass of each particle is the same (\( 44 \, u \)). However, the average particle speed in Sample A is higher (\( 1,400 \, m/s \)) compared to Sample B (\( 1,300 \, m/s \)).

Since the mass is the same for all particles in both samples, the difference in kinetic energy will be due to the difference in speed. The particle with the higher speed in Sample A will have a greater kinetic energy than the particles in Sample B, which have a lower speed.

Therefore, the sample with the higher average particle speed (Sample A) has the higher average kinetic energy and thus the higher temperature.","sample A

2. **Objective**: Joy wants to investigate how fabric affects the warming of an object when exposed to sunlight.

Given these supplies, Joy can set up an experiment where she wraps one glass jar in a black cotton shirt and the other in a white cotton shirt, then places both jars in the sun. By using thermometers, she can measure the temperature of each jar over time to determine which fabric causes the jar to heat up more.

Option A cannot be investigated because it involves comparing the heating effect of different sizes of jars (large vs. small) while keeping the fabric constant, which is not relevant to the fabric's effect on warming.

Option B cannot be investigated because it involves comparing the heating effect of different fabrics (cotton vs. wool) while keeping the size of the jar constant, which is also not relevant to the fabric's effect on warming.

Therefore, option C is the most suitable choice as it directly addresses the effect of fabric color on the warming of an object under sunlight, using the available supplies.","Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!",0.229733717034903,0.0059710507158715,0.1926605454928038,0.1025641025641025,7

"Complete the statement. Assume that Joseph's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Joseph and Earth () as he hiked toward the summit.","increased
stayed the same
decreased",0,0,increased,"The correct answer is A. increased.

Explanation: When Joseph hiked up the mountain, his height above the ground increased. As his height increases, so does his gravitational potential energy with respect to the Earth. Gravitational potential energy (PE) is given by the formula:

\[ PE = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the Earth's surface). Since Joseph's mass (\( m \)) did not change, and his height (\( h \)) increased as he hiked toward the summit, his gravitational potential energy also increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Joseph and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.","increased.

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the Earth's surface). Since Joseph's mass (\( m \)) did not change, and his height (\( h \)) increased as he hiked toward the summit, his gravitational potential energy also increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Joseph and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.","Think about how the distance between Joseph and the center of Earth changed.
The summit of the mountain was higher than the point where Joseph started hiking. As he hiked toward the summit, the distance between Joseph and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Joseph and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

C. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- **Sewing an apron**: This involves manipulating fabric and thread to create a garment. The process does not involve any chemical reactions; it's purely a physical transformation of materials into a new form.
- **Mixing lettuce and salad dressing**: This involves combining ingredients, which can be considered a physical change because no new substances are created through chemical reactions. However, the act of mixing itself is a physical action rather than a chemical one.

Both activities described do not involve any chemical changes or heating/cooling processes that would alter the chemical composition of the materials involved. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

The supply probably went up.",1,1,The supply probably went up.,"The correct answer is:

B. The supply probably went up.

Explanation:
When more people move into an area, it typically increases the demand for housing. However, in this scenario, fewer people are moving into Richmond (50,000 people lived there last year, but only 42,000 remain after 8,000 moved away). This decrease in population means that the demand for housing might not increase as much as it would if more people were moving in. 

Additionally, the question does not provide information about new construction or changes in the number of available houses for sale. Without such details, we can infer that the primary change affecting the supply of houses for sale is the reduced population. Since fewer people are living in Richmond, there may be fewer buyers looking for homes, which could lead to a surplus of houses on the market. Therefore, the supply of houses for sale in Richmond likely went up.","The supply probably went up.

What is the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears? Choose the most likely ratio.,"3:1
0:4
2:2
4:0
1:3",1,1,0:4,"The correct answer is B. 0:4.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are homozygous recessive for dumbo ears (ee). When two recessive alleles (e) combine, the offspring will all inherit one e allele from each parent, resulting in the genotype ee. Since the allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e), the presence of any E allele will result in normal ears. Therefore, none of the offspring will have the genotype EE or Ee, which would result in normal ears. All four offspring will have the genotype ee, which results in dumbo ears. Thus, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 4:0.","0:4.

When two recessive alleles (e) combine, the offspring will all inherit one e allele from each parent, resulting in the genotype ee. Since the allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e), the presence of any E allele will result in normal ears. Therefore, none of the offspring will have the genotype EE or Ee, which would result in normal ears. All four offspring will have the genotype ee, which results in dumbo ears. Thus, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 4:0.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with normal ears.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0441254477692962,0.0173073890804402,0.3283582045790946,0.2857142857142857,8

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for the coat pattern trait in leopards has two alleles: A (spotted coat) and a (black coat). Since Tora has a black coat and has two alleles for a black coat, her genotype must be ""aa"". This means that both of Tora's alleles are the ""a"" allele, which corresponds to a black coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Instead, it is a personal attack on those who disagree with the need for more security guards.","The text argues that you're a thief if you don't agree that museum security measures must be increased. However, you may have a variety of reasons for not wanting to increase museum security. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.

Explanation: The term ""golden years"" is a euphemism that is commonly used to refer to the later stages of life, often associated with retirement and leisure. It suggests that Mr. Dudley is an older person who is now enjoying his retirement or senior years. The phrase ""luxurious beachside community"" further supports this interpretation by indicating a lifestyle typically enjoyed by those who have retired and have the means to live comfortably. The mention of being ""just down the street from his grandchildren"" implies that he is close to his family, which is consistent with the idea of enjoying one's golden years.

A. This ecosystem has:
- warm summers and warm winters
- a rainy season and a dry season
- soil that is poor in nutrients

**Explanation:**

A savanna grassland ecosystem is characterized by its climate, vegetation, and soil conditions. Here's why option A is correct:

1. **Climate**: Savannas typically have a distinct wet and dry season pattern. The wet season brings heavy rainfall, while the dry season can be very long and arid. Summers are generally warm, and winters are also relatively warm, though they may not be as hot as the summer months.

2. **Vegetation**: The dominant vegetation in a savanna is grasses, which thrive during the wet season but can survive the dry season with minimal water. Trees are scattered throughout the landscape, often with adaptations to withstand droughts (like deep roots or fire-resistant bark).

3. **Soil**: The soil in savannas is generally poor in nutrients due to the rapid decomposition of organic matter under the hot sun and the leaching effect of heavy rains. This nutrient-poor soil supports the grasses but limits the growth of other types of vegetation.

Option B is incorrect because savannas do not have year-round rain; they have a distinct wet and dry season. Additionally, savannas do not have many different types of organisms compared to tropical rainforests, which are more diverse.

Option C is incorrect because savannas do not have long, cold winters and short, cool summers. They have warm summers and warm winters, similar to the description in option A. Furthermore, savannas do not have many evergreen trees; they have scattered trees and grasses.","This ecosystem has:

"Based on this information, what is Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait?","a hairy body
a hairless body",1,1,a hairless body,"The correct answer is B. a hairless body.

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for the body hair trait in deer mice has two alleles: B (hairy body) and b (hairless body). The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means that if an individual has at least one B allele, they will express the hairy body phenotype. Conversely, if an individual has only the b allele (bb), they will express the hairless body phenotype.

Since Skippy has the homozygous genotype bb, he has two copies of the recessive allele for a hairless body. Therefore, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body.","a hairless body.

The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means that if an individual has at least one B allele, they will express the hairy body phenotype. Conversely, if an individual has only the b allele (bb), they will express the hairless body phenotype.

Since Skippy has the homozygous genotype bb, he has two copies of the recessive allele for a hairless body. Therefore, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body.","Skippy's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Skippy's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.
To check this answer, consider whether Skippy's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Skippy's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0105371196352743,0.0053858515861868,0.3661971790517754,0.2,7

4/4",4,-1,,"The correct answer is E. 4/4.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, all four boxes contain the genotype ""Nn,"" which represents a heterozygous offspring. Since the allele for normal wings (N) is dominant over the allele for vestigial wings (n), any offspring with at least one N allele will have normal wings. Therefore, all four offspring will have normal wings, resulting in a probability of 4/4 or 100% that a fruit fly produced by this cross will have normal wings.",,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

3. **Phenotype Determination**: Since Kiki has the genotype Hh, she has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h). Because the dominant allele (H) is for straight whiskers, Kiki will express the trait associated with the dominant allele, which is straight whiskers.

First, consider the alleles in Kiki's genotype for the whisker type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Kiki's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be straight whiskers.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0241084497171148,0.0114502033198668,0.3211009133608282,0.208955223880597,7

rain forming in a cloud","Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.",0,0,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is A. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Water evaporating from a puddle** is a physical change because it involves water changing from a liquid state to a gas (water vapor) without any change in its chemical composition. The molecules of water simply move faster, changing their state but not their identity.

- **Rain forming in a cloud** is also a physical change. When water vapor condenses into liquid droplets within a cloud, it changes from a gas back to a liquid. This process does not involve any chemical reaction; it's merely a phase change where the state of matter changes but the chemical properties remain the same.

Both processes do not involve the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, which would be necessary for a chemical change to occur. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes. Neither process is caused by heating nor cooling exclusively; they can be influenced by various factors such as temperature and humidity, but the fundamental nature of the changes themselves is physical.","Both are only physical changes.

Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Rain begins to form when water vapor in the air becomes liquid water. This is caused by cooling. But water evaporating from a puddle is not.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.

"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The surfers rode the wave as it () towards the coastline.","sprinted

A. sprinted

Explanation: Personification is a literary device where human characteristics are attributed to non-human entities. In this context, we want to give the wave a human-like action. ""Sprinted"" is a verb that implies a quick, fast movement, which can be used to describe the dynamic and forceful motion of a wave moving quickly towards the shore. On the other hand, ""moved"" is a more neutral term that does not convey the same sense of urgency or energy.

So, the sentence would read: ""The surfers rode the wave as it sprinted towards the coastline."" This choice effectively uses personification by attributing the human action of sprinting to the wave.","sprinted

Which type of relationship is formed when a hawk moth visits a petunia flower?,"commensal
mutualistic
parasitic",1,1,mutualistic,"The correct answer is B. mutualistic.

Explanation: The relationship between the hawk moth and the petunia flower is mutualistic because both organisms benefit from this interaction. The hawk moth benefits by obtaining nectar for food, which is essential for its survival. In return, the petunia flower benefits by having its pollen transferred to other flowers, which aids in the process of pollination and reproduction. This mutual benefit is a key characteristic of a mutualistic relationship.","mutualistic.

In return, the petunia flower benefits by having its pollen transferred to other flowers, which aids in the process of pollination and reproduction. This mutual benefit is a key characteristic of a mutualistic relationship.","When a hawk moth visits a petunia flower, the moth drinks nectar. The moth uses the nectar to survive and grow. So, the moth benefits from its relationship with the petunia.
The petunia flower is pollinated when the moth visits it. After the petunia is pollinated, it is able to reproduce. So, the petunia also benefits from its relationship with the moth.
Since both the moth and the petunia benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a hawk moth pollinates a petunia flower.

When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.

After Scott explained the chemistry homework to Ed, Scott understood it better, too.",0,0,"After Scott explained the chemistry homework to Ed, he understood it better, too.","The correct answer is:

A. After Scott explained the chemistry homework to Ed, he understood it better, too.

Explanation: In this sentence, ""he"" could refer to either Scott or Ed, making the pronoun reference vague. The ambiguity arises because it's not clear whether the person who understood the chemistry homework better was Scott (who explained it) or Ed (to whom Scott explained it). To avoid vagueness, one should specify which person understood the homework better. 

For example, the sentence could be rewritten as:

- ""After Scott explained the chemistry homework to Ed, Scott understood it better, too.""
- ""After Scott explained the chemistry homework to Ed, Ed understood it better, too.""

This way, there is no ambiguity about who understood the homework better.","After Scott explained the chemistry homework to Ed, he understood it better, too.

A. Sheep's wool is used to make all kinds of clothing.

Explanation:
- A statement that is a fact provides information that can be proven true or false based on evidence or reality.

Here's the reasoning:

Wanda's interest in skipping rocks suggests she wants to explore variables that might influence the number of skips.

This means she cannot use the size of the rock as a variable since all the rocks are either small or large, but not both.

However, she does have two types of rocks: flat and round. By comparing flat rocks to round rocks, she can investigate whether the shape of the rock affects its ability to skip. This aligns perfectly with her observation that some rocks skip multiple times while others skip just once and then sink.

Therefore, using the available supplies, Wanda can conduct an experiment to determine if the shape (flat vs. round) of the rock influences the number of skips it makes when thrown across the river.","""Do round rocks or flat rocks skip more times when thrown across the river?""

The supplies she has include 10 small flat rocks and 10 large flat rocks, both of which are flat. This means she cannot use the size of the rock as a variable since all the rocks are either small or large, but not both.

However, she does have two types of rocks: flat and round. By comparing flat rocks to round rocks, she can investigate whether the shape of the rock affects its ability to skip. This aligns perfectly with her observation that some rocks skip multiple times while others skip just once and then sink.

Therefore, using the available supplies, Wanda can conduct an experiment to determine if the shape (flat vs. round) of the rock influences the number of skips it makes when thrown across the river.","Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!",0.2017012524910613,0.0047703113221373,0.2364531969715354,0.1282051282051282,7

Explanation: A bike path can vary in length depending on its purpose, location, and the area it serves. However, for a general estimate, a bike path that is 2 miles long is quite common. This length allows for a reasonable distance to ride, which is suitable for recreational purposes or short commutes. The other options (2 feet, 2 inches, and 2 yards) are much shorter distances and would not be practical for a bike path designed for cycling.","The best estimate for the length of a bike path is 2 miles.
2 inches, 2 feet, and 2 yards are all too short.

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using customary units, length may be written with units of inches, feet, yards, or miles.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and 3 feet in 1 yard. There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile.

C. False dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist.

Explanation:
The statement ""If we don't raise taxes, we are condemning our schools to failure"" implies that there are only two possible outcomes: raising taxes or failing schools. This is a false dichotomy because it excludes other potential solutions such as increasing funding through other means (e.g., cutting back on unnecessary expenditures, reallocating funds, or seeking private sector involvement), improving teaching methods, or enhancing parental involvement. The argument oversimplifies the issue by presenting a binary choice where in reality, there could be multiple strategies to address the funding needs of public schools.","False dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist.

B. an elementary substance

Explanation:
Nitrogen is an elementary substance, which means it is composed of only one type of atom. In this case, nitrogen is made up of nitrogen atoms (N). The chemical formula for nitrogen gas, which is the most common form of nitrogen in the atmosphere, is N₂, indicating that two nitrogen atoms bond together to form a molecule.

A compound, on the other hand, is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms bonded together. Examples of compounds include water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆).

Since nitrogen gas consists solely of nitrogen atoms, it fits the definition of an elementary substance rather than a compound.","an elementary substance

A compound, on the other hand, is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms bonded together. Examples of compounds include water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆).

Since nitrogen gas consists solely of nitrogen atoms, it fits the definition of an elementary substance rather than a compound.","You can tell whether nitrogen is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for nitrogen, N2, contains one atomic symbol: N. So, the formula tells you that nitrogen is composed of only one chemical element.
Since nitrogen is composed of only one chemical element, nitrogen is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0306649266601716,0.0059986374367654,0.3609756051160024,0.2264150943396226,8

The other options, Lynx canadensis and Lynx rufus, belong to the genus Lynx, which is different from the genus of the sand cat. Therefore, the sand cat shares its genus with Felis margarita.","A sand cat's scientific name is Felis margarita. The first word of its scientific name is Felis.
Lynx canadensis is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx canadensis and Felis margarita are not in the same genus.
Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx rufus and Felis margarita are not in the same genus.
This organism and the sand cat are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Felis margarita.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

"What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
beating an egg","Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.",0,0,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is A. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Erosion caused by wind**: This is a physical change because it involves the movement of particles (sand, soil) without altering their chemical composition. The wind simply moves these particles from one place to another, which is a physical process.

- **Beating an egg**: This is also a physical change. When you beat an egg, you are changing its shape and structure (breaking the shell and mixing the contents), but the chemical composition of the egg remains the same. There is no chemical reaction occurring that would alter the egg's molecular structure.

Both processes do not involve any chemical reactions or changes in the fundamental properties of the materials involved, making them both physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

When you beat an egg, you are changing its shape and structure (breaking the shell and mixing the contents), but the chemical composition of the egg remains the same. There is no chemical reaction occurring that would alter the egg's molecular structure.

Both processes do not involve any chemical reactions or changes in the fundamental properties of the materials involved, making them both physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0643918441565115,0.0136919789300887,0.2660550410941841,0.1666666666666666,8

Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.
During his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.
A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
After Samantha left work, she stopped at the bank, and then she went to the gym.
Sometimes a dependent clause in a complex or compound-complex sentence can interrupt an independent clause.

"What do these two changes have in common?
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas
water freezing into ice","Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.",1,1,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas**: Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) sublimates directly from a solid to a gas without passing through the liquid phase. This process involves a change in state but does not involve the formation of new substances, making it a physical change.

- **Water freezing into ice**: When water freezes, it changes from a liquid to a solid without the formation of new substances. This is also a physical change because no new chemical compounds are created; it's simply a change in the state of matter.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions that would result in the formation of new substances, which is characteristic of physical changes. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes described do not involve any chemical reactions that would result in the formation of new substances, which is characteristic of physical changes. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from solid to liquid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But water freezing into ice is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water freezing is caused by cooling. But dry ice sublimating is not.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0705147936736388,0.0108108520027162,0.3457943878657525,0.2857142857142857,7

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample B
sample A",1,1,sample B,"B. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average particle speed is the same for both samples (1,500 m/s), we need to consider the mass of the particles to determine which sample has the higher temperature.

The formula for kinetic energy (KE) is given by:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle.

Given that the average particle speed (\( v \)) is the same for both samples (1,500 m/s), the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles.

- Sample A has particles with a mass of 17 u.
- Sample B has particles with a mass of 28 u.

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A, the particles in Sample B have a higher average kinetic energy. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the average particle speed is the same for both samples (1,500 m/s), we need to consider the mass of the particles to determine which sample has the higher temperature.

The formula for kinetic energy (KE) is given by:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle.

Given that the average particle speed (\( v \)) is the same for both samples (1,500 m/s), the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles.

- Sample A has particles with a mass of 17 u.
- Sample B has particles with a mass of 28 u.

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A, the particles in Sample B have a higher average kinetic energy. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.4797687861271676,0.1579095438891948,0.3965517193891201,0.8125,7
"Complete the statement.
Gallium arsenide is ().","a compound
an elementary substance",0,0,a compound,"The correct answer is:

A. a compound

Explanation:
A compound is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together. In the case of gallium arsenide (GaAs), it is a binary compound because it consists of two different elements, gallium (Ga) and arsenic (As). The chemical formula GaAs indicates that one atom of gallium is bonded to one atom of arsenic.

An elementary substance, on the other hand, is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Examples of elementary substances include elements like hydrogen (H₂), oxygen (O₂), and carbon (C₆H₁₂O₆).

Since gallium arsenide is made up of two different elements bonded together, it fits the definition of a compound rather than an elementary substance.","a compound

Since gallium arsenide is made up of two different elements bonded together, it fits the definition of a compound rather than an elementary substance.","You can tell whether gallium arsenide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for gallium arsenide, GaAs, contains two atomic symbols: Ga for gallium and As for arsenic. So, the formula tells you that gallium arsenide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since gallium arsenide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, gallium arsenide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0398699737980044,0.005173452411371,0.4038461492349298,0.3090909090909091,8

"What do these two changes have in common?
a banana getting ripe on the counter
saliva breaking down a piece of bread","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.",3,3,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is D. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- A banana getting ripe on the counter involves the breakdown of starches into sugars, which is a chemical process. This change is due to enzymes that break down the complex carbohydrates (starch) into simpler sugars like glucose and fructose. This process is not affected by cooling or heating but rather by the presence of specific enzymes and temperature, which are typically within a range that promotes enzyme activity.

- Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is also a chemical process. When you chew bread, saliva contains an enzyme called amylase, which breaks down the starch in the bread into simpler sugars such as maltose. This process occurs at body temperature, which is around 37°C (98.6°F), and does not require cooling or heating.

Both processes involve the conversion of one substance into another through the action of enzymes, which is characteristic of chemical changes. Physical changes, on the other hand, involve changes in the state or form of matter without altering its chemical composition, such as melting or boiling. Cooling or heating can sometimes cause physical changes, but they are not the defining characteristics of the processes described here.","Both are chemical changes.

Cooling or heating can sometimes cause physical changes, but they are not the defining characteristics of the processes described here.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter.
Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.
The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.1559260393026431,0.0436477253981545,0.3372548969830066,0.3278688524590163,7

The Arctic fox has an arrow pointing to it from the bilberry. The bilberry is a producer, so the Arctic fox is a primary consumer.
The barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. The lichen is a producer, so the barren-ground caribou is a primary consumer.
The rough-legged hawk has an arrow pointing to it from the parasitic jaeger. The parasitic jaeger is not a producer, so the rough-legged hawk is not a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

"Complete the statement. Assume that the submarine's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the submarine and Earth () as the submarine dove toward the ocean floor.","decreased
stayed the same
increased",0,0,decreased,"The correct answer is A. decreased.

Explanation: Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy an object possesses due to its position relative to other objects with mass, such as the Earth. The formula for gravitational potential energy is given by:

\[ \text{GPE} = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the object,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the surface of the ocean).

In the scenario described, the submarine is diving towards the ocean floor, which means it is moving closer to the Earth's surface. As the submarine descends, the height \( h \) decreases. Since the mass \( m \) of the submarine does not change, and the acceleration due to gravity \( g \) remains constant on Earth, the gravitational potential energy will decrease because the product \( m \cdot g \cdot h \) decreases as \( h \) decreases.

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the submarine and Earth decreases as the submarine dives toward the ocean floor.","decreased.

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the submarine and Earth decreases as the submarine dives toward the ocean floor.","Think about how the distance between the submarine and the center of Earth changed.
The ocean floor is lower than the surface of the ocean. As the submarine dove toward the ocean floor, the distance between the submarine and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the submarine and Earth decreased as the submarine dove toward the ocean floor.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, all the offspring (Rr) have one dominant allele (R) and one recessive allele (r) for the gene controlling cheek color. Since the dominant allele (R) is for bright orange cheeks, all the offspring will express the bright orange cheek phenotype. Therefore, the probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks is 4/4 or 100%.","0/4.

Since the dominant allele (R) is for bright orange cheeks, all the offspring will express the bright orange cheek phenotype. Therefore, the probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks is 4/4 or 100%.","Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0055519989343733,0.0011458242441199,0.2528735594398204,0.173076923076923,8

To find this out, read the passage carefully.
The Cascade Range is a volcanic arc in the Pacific Northwest that begins in California and runs north into British Columbia. As the North American Plate and the Juan de Fuca Plate move toward each other, oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts, or sinks, below continental crust of the North American Plate.
There are eighteen volcanoes in the Cascade Range, and some of them are still active. Mount St. Helens is an active volcano near Seattle, Washington. It last erupted in May of 1980.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Cascade Range formed as the two plates moved toward each other. So, the Cascade Range formed at a convergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.

Circular reasoning, also known as circular logic, occurs when an argument asserts that what it is trying to prove is already assumed to be true within the argument itself. In this case, the statement ""The most delicious avocados in the U.S. are grown in California because California avocados have the best taste"" is an example of circular reasoning because it assumes that California avocados are the best (which is what it's trying to prove) and then concludes that they are the best because they are from California.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. The statement claims that California avocados are the most delicious.
2. It then states that California avocados are the most delicious because they are from California.

This is a classic example of circular reasoning because it does not provide any independent evidence or reasoning to support the claim that California avocados are the most delicious; instead, it relies on the assumption that being from California makes them the most delicious.

The other options can be ruled out:
- A. False dichotomy: This would involve presenting only two options when there are more, but the given statement does not present a false dichotomy.
- B. Guilt by association: This involves associating a person or thing with a negative characteristic to discredit them, which is not applicable here since the statement is about the quality of avocados, not about discrediting California avocados.

Lithium bromide is ().","a compound
an elementary substance",0,0,a compound,"The correct answer is:

A. a compound

Explanation:
A compound is a substance composed of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together. Lithium bromide, with the chemical formula LiBr, is a binary ionic compound consisting of one atom of lithium (Li) and one atom of bromine (Br). Since it contains two different elements (lithium and bromine), it fits the definition of a compound.

An elementary substance, on the other hand, is a substance that consists of only one type of atom. Examples include elements like hydrogen (H₂), oxygen (O₂), or iron (Fe). Lithium bromide does not fit this description because it is made up of two different types of atoms.

Therefore, based on its composition, lithium bromide is classified as a compound.","a compound

Lithium bromide, with the chemical formula LiBr, is a binary ionic compound consisting of one atom of lithium (Li) and one atom of bromine (Br).

An elementary substance, on the other hand, is a substance that consists of only one type of atom. Examples include elements like hydrogen (H₂), oxygen (O₂), or iron (Fe). Lithium bromide does not fit this description because it is made up of two different types of atoms.

Therefore, based on its composition, lithium bromide is classified as a compound.","You can tell whether lithium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for lithium bromide, LiBr, contains two atomic symbols: Li for lithium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that lithium bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since lithium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, lithium bromide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.036381351090679,0.0028119810394874,0.3636363590082644,0.3035714285714285,8

A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.

"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
The volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury.","true
false",0,0,true,"A. true

Explanation: To determine if the statement is true, we need to compare the volumes of Earth and Mercury. The volume of Earth is given as 1.08 x 10^12 km³, and the volume of Mercury is 6.08 x 10^10 km³. 

To check if Earth's volume is more than ten times that of Mercury, we can divide the volume of Earth by the volume of Mercury:

(1.08 x 10^12 km³) / (6.08 x 10^10 km³) ≈ 17.79

Since 17.79 is greater than 10, the volume of Earth is indeed more than ten times the volume of Mercury. Therefore, the statement is true.","true

Explanation: To determine if the statement is true, we need to compare the volumes of Earth and Mercury. The volume of Earth is given as 1.08 x 10^12 km³, and the volume of Mercury is 6.08 x 10^10 km³.

Since 17.79 is greater than 10, the volume of Earth is indeed more than ten times the volume of Mercury. Therefore, the statement is true.","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is greater than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)

It is involved in modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other parts of the cell.

- **B. Plant cells can have vacuoles but do not have mitochondria:** This statement is false. Plant cells do indeed contain mitochondria, which are essential organelles for cellular respiration and energy production. Vacuoles are also present in plant cells and serve various functions such as storage, waste disposal, and maintaining turgor pressure.

- **C. The endoplasmic reticulum breaks down sugar to release energy that a plant cell can use:** This statement is false. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) does not break down sugar; it is involved in protein synthesis and modification, lipid synthesis, and transport of materials within the cell. The process of breaking down sugar to release energy occurs primarily through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, which take place in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively.","The Golgi is inside the cell membrane in an animal cell.**

In both Solution A and Solution B, there are two green particles dissolved in 25 mL of solvent. Therefore, the concentration of green particles in both solutions is the same.","In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.

In this case, the statement ""Tessa is very sociable and friendly, she's not exactly a team player"" presents a contradiction because it simultaneously describes Tessa as sociable and friendly (positive traits) and as not being a good team player (a negative trait). This creates a paradoxical situation where the same person is both well-liked and not a good collaborator, which is a common scenario in real-life situations.

Option A, euphemism, refers to a mild or indirect word or expression used in place of one considered harsh, blunt, or offensive. The given text does not use any mild or indirect language to avoid harshness or offense; instead, it directly states the characteristics of Tessa without any euphemistic language. Therefore, a euphemism is not applicable here.","paradox

2. **Objective**: Estelle wants to investigate what factors affect sledding speed. The hint suggests she notices differences in speed among her friends and wants to test specific materials.

3. **Experiment Design**: To determine which material affects sledding speed, Estelle should compare two different materials directly. This allows her to isolate the variable (material) and observe its effect on speed.

4. **Comparison Options**:
   - **Option A**: Comparing a rubber inner tube sled and a large plastic sled. This would be less effective because the size difference could also influence the results.
   - **Option B**: Comparing a rubber inner tube sled and a plastic sled. This is a direct comparison between two different materials, allowing Estelle to see if one material consistently affects speed more than the other.
   - **Option C**: Comparing a plastic sled and a wooden sled. While this would also be interesting, it introduces a new variable (wooden sled), making it harder to isolate the effect of the material being tested.

Assume all other forces on the cat are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the cat?,"The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cat.
The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cat.",1,1,"The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cat.","The correct answer is:

B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cat.

Explanation:
To determine whether the forces on the cat are balanced or unbalanced, we need to consider the forces acting on it. In this scenario, we have two forces acting on the cat:
1. The gravitational force (weight) pulling the cat downward, which is 40N.
2. The normal force (upward force) exerted by the bottom of the box on the cat, which is also 40N.

Since these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they cancel each other out. This means that the net force on the cat is zero. When the net force on an object is zero, the object is in equilibrium, meaning it will not accelerate; it will remain at rest if it was initially at rest, or continue moving at a constant velocity if it was already in motion.

Therefore, because the forces are balanced, there is no net force on the cat, and the correct choice is B.","The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cat.

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.0437591632608887,0.0013081164613216,0.1560283642593432,0.0681818181818181,8

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A
sample B",1,1,sample A,"B. sample A

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is its speed, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 30 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 1,900 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 28 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 1,800 m/s

Calculating the kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \, \text{u} \times (1,900 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \, \text{u} \times (1,800 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the speed of the particles in Sample A is higher than that in Sample B, and the mass difference between the particles in the two samples is relatively small, the higher speed in Sample A results in a greater kinetic energy per particle compared to Sample B. Therefore, Sample A has the higher temperature.","sample A

"Complete the statement. Assume that Edgar's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth () as he hiked toward the summit.","stayed the same

Explanation: When Edgar hiked up the mountain, his height above the ground increased. As his height increases, so does his gravitational potential energy with respect to the Earth. Gravitational potential energy (PE) is given by the formula:

\[ PE = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the Earth's surface). Since Edgar's mass (\( m \)) did not change, and his height (\( h \)) increased as he hiked toward the summit, his gravitational potential energy also increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.","increased.

\[ PE = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the Earth's surface). Since Edgar's mass (\( m \)) did not change, and his height (\( h \)) increased as he hiked toward the summit, his gravitational potential energy also increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.","Think about how the distance between Edgar and the center of Earth changed.
The summit of the mountain was higher than the point where Edgar started hiking. As he hiked toward the summit, the distance between Edgar and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

"Based on this information, what is Minnie's phenotype for the fur texture trait?","wavy fur

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup). The fur texture trait in Syrian hamsters is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: F (for straight fur) and f (for wavy fur).

- The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f).
- The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive.

Minnie has the heterozygous genotype Ff. This means she has one dominant allele (F) and one recessive allele (f). In cases where there is a dominant allele present, the phenotype will be that of the dominant allele. Therefore, even though Minnie has the recessive allele (f), the dominant allele (F) will mask it, resulting in her having straight fur.

Thus, Minnie's phenotype for the fur texture trait is straight fur.","You need to determine Minnie's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Minnie's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Minnie's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Minnie's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0351950317387933,0.0120034598281195,0.3913043433436672,0.2461538461538461,8

A. lounged in

Explanation: Personification is a literary device where human characteristics are attributed to non-human entities. In this context, we want to give the impression that the rusted old cars have a human-like quality by describing their position or state in a way that suggests they are relaxed or at ease.

- ""Languished in"" implies a state of decay or neglect, which fits well with the image of rusted old cars in a junkyard. It suggests that the cars are not actively moving but rather are in a state of rest or abandonment, which is a common scenario for vehicles in a junkyard.

- ""Could be found in"" is more of a straightforward description and does not convey the same sense of personification as ""languished in."" It simply states a fact without attributing any human-like qualities to the cars.

Explanation:
A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions (such as ""and,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" ""nor,"" ""for,"" ""so,"" or ""yet"") without any dependent clauses. For example: ""Susan is a competitive horseback rider, and she will be competing in the next World Equestrian Games.""

A complex sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. For example: ""Since Susan is a competitive horseback rider, she will be competing in the next World Equestrian Games.""

A compound-complex sentence combines elements of both compound and complex sentences. It has at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. The given sentence fits this description because it contains:

1. An independent clause: ""Susan is a competitive horseback rider.""
2. Another independent clause: ""she will be competing in the next World Equestrian Games.""
3. A dependent clause: ""which are held every four years,"" which modifies the noun phrase ""World Equestrian Games.""

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.0408418857101628,0.0012857472526566,0.2191780775304936,0.0681818181818181,7
What is the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes? Choose the most likely ratio.,"2:2
0:4
1:3
4:0
3:1",1,-1,,"The correct answer is E. 3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are heterozygous (Ee), meaning they each have one dominant allele (E) for red eyes and one recessive allele (e) for black eyes. When two heterozygous parents (Ee x Ee) are crossed, the possible genotypes of their offspring can be predicted using the Punnett square:

- EE (red eyes): 1/4
- Ee (red eyes): 2/4
- ee (black eyes): 1/4

Since the allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e), all offspring with at least one E allele will have red eyes. Therefore, the ratio of offspring with black eyes (ee) to those with red eyes (EE or Ee) is 1:3. This means that out of every four offspring, three will have red eyes and one will have black eyes.",,"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with black eyes. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with red eyes.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

South American farmers have just harvested their largest cocoa crops in years. Cocoa is a major ingredient in chocolate. What will probably happen to the overall supply of chocolate bars?,"The supply will probably go up.
The supply will probably go down.",0,0,The supply will probably go up.,"The correct answer is:

A. The supply will probably go up.

Explanation:
When South American farmers harvest their largest cocoa crops in years, it means there is an increase in the availability of cocoa beans. Since cocoa is a major ingredient in chocolate, this increase in cocoa supply will likely lead to an increase in the production of chocolate bars. Producers will be able to make more chocolate bars with the additional cocoa available, which will result in a higher overall supply of chocolate bars on the market. This increased supply could potentially lead to lower prices for consumers as well, assuming demand remains stable or increases at a similar rate.","The supply will probably go up.

If more cocoa has been harvested, cocoa will be easier to get. So, the supply of chocolate bars will probably go up.

Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.",0.1670453963762822,0.0304645085210209,0.3030302980966024,0.2325581395348837,7
"What do these two changes have in common?

mixing chocolate syrup into milk","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.",3,3,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is:

D. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:
- **Breaking a ceramic plate** is a physical change because it involves the breaking of solid material without any chemical reaction occurring. The plate is simply fractured, but its chemical composition remains unchanged.
- **Mixing chocolate syrup into milk** is also a physical change. When you mix chocolate syrup with milk, you are combining two substances that do not undergo a chemical reaction; they simply blend together to form a new mixture. The properties of the individual substances (chocolate syrup and milk) remain the same, just in a different form.

Both actions described do not involve any chemical reactions or changes in the molecular structure of the materials involved. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both actions described do not involve any chemical reactions or changes in the molecular structure of the materials involved. Therefore, both are classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. Making a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.073965659461694,0.0171976265466815,0.3084112101842956,0.2131147540983606,8
"Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait?","bumpy fruit
smooth fruit",0,0,bumpy fruit,"The correct answer is:

A. bumpy fruit

Explanation:
In the given scenario, the gene for the fruit texture trait in cucumber plants has two alleles: F (for bumpy fruit) and f (for smooth fruit). The allele for smooth fruit (f) is recessive, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (ff) to express the smooth fruit phenotype.

The question states that the cucumber plant in question has the homozygous genotype FF. This means the plant has two dominant alleles (F) for bumpy fruit. Since the dominant allele (F) is for bumpy fruit, the plant will express the bumpy fruit phenotype regardless of whether the recessive allele (f) is present or not.

Therefore, the phenotype of the cucumber plant with the genotype FF is bumpy fruit.","bumpy fruit

Explanation:
In the given scenario, the gene for the fruit texture trait in cucumber plants has two alleles: F (for bumpy fruit) and f (for smooth fruit). The allele for smooth fruit (f) is recessive, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (ff) to express the smooth fruit phenotype.

The question states that the cucumber plant in question has the homozygous genotype FF. This means the plant has two dominant alleles (F) for bumpy fruit. Since the dominant allele (F) is for bumpy fruit, the plant will express the bumpy fruit phenotype regardless of whether the recessive allele (f) is present or not.

Therefore, the phenotype of the cucumber plant with the genotype FF is bumpy fruit.","The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is FF. The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for bumpy fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be bumpy fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for bumpy fruit (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be bumpy fruit.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0164909323866474,0.0046480360695152,0.3551401828002446,0.2769230769230769,7

Explanation: The bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus. In biological classification, organisms in the same genus share the same first part of their binomial nomenclature (the genus). Therefore, any organism that shares the genus ""Lynx"" with the bobcat would be in the same genus. Option A, Lynx canadensis, is another species within the genus Lynx, which includes the bobcat. The other options do not belong to the genus Lynx.","A bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx.
Lynx canadensis is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx canadensis and Lynx rufus are in the same genus.
Macropus rufus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Macropus rufus and Lynx rufus have the same species name within their genus, rufus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Macropus rufus is in the genus Macropus, and Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx.
Python molurus is in the genus Python. The first word of its scientific name is Python. So, Python molurus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0283481837141994,0.0093857826917222,0.3458646569257731,0.1714285714285714,8

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are homozygous dominant for the yellow ground spot trait (GG). When two homozygous dominant individuals (GG x GG) are crossed, all the offspring will inherit one G allele from each parent, resulting in a genotype of GG for all offspring. Since the allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g), all the offspring will express the yellow ground spot trait. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0.","4:0.

When two homozygous dominant individuals (GG x GG) are crossed, all the offspring will inherit one G allele from each parent, resulting in a genotype of GG for all offspring. Since the allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g), all the offspring will express the yellow ground spot trait. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.
A yellow ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.
A white ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype gg.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a white ground spot.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0192283462654481,0.00966795980291,0.3101604237456032,0.2745098039215686,8

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

It simply indicates one of the applications of sodium bromide but does not change its fundamental nature as a compound.","You can tell whether sodium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for sodium bromide, NaBr, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that sodium bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since sodium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium bromide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.013718262868179,0.0007635685738879,0.3115577845115023,0.2142857142857142,8

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

Explanation: Concentration is defined as the amount of solute (blue particles) in a given volume of solvent (solution). In both Solution A and Solution B, there are four blue particles in 20 mL of solvent. Therefore, the concentration of blue particles in both solutions is the same.","In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of blue particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

**A. Do toy cars go faster down the ramp made of wood or the ramp made of cardboard?**

Here’s the reasoning:

- **Jasper's Supplies:** He has two identical toy cars, a wooden ramp, and a cardboard ramp.
- **Experiment Design:** To investigate the effect of different materials on the speed of the toy cars, Jasper needs to use the same type of toy car in both conditions (wooden ramp vs. cardboard ramp). This ensures that any differences in speed are due to the material of the ramp rather than differences between the cars themselves.

Let's examine why the other options are not suitable:

- **Option B:** ""Do toy cars with plastic wheels go faster down the cardboard ramp than toy cars with metal wheels?"" - This option introduces a new variable (different wheel materials) which would make it difficult to isolate the effect of the ramp material alone. The results could be influenced by the wheels as well.
  
- **Option C:** ""Does a big toy car go down the wooden ramp faster than a small toy car?"" - This option introduces another variable (size of the toy car), making it impossible to determine if the difference in speed is due to the size of the car or the material of the ramp.

Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate choice because it allows Jasper to focus solely on the material of the ramp as the variable affecting the speed of the toy cars.","Do toy cars go faster down the ramp made of wood or the ramp made of cardboard?**

Since hydrazine contains both nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, it is classified as a compound. An elementary substance, on the other hand, is composed of only one type of atom, such as oxygen (O2) or carbon (C). Therefore, hydrazine is not an elementary substance but rather a compound.","a compound.

An elementary substance, on the other hand, is composed of only one type of atom, such as oxygen (O2) or carbon (C). Therefore, hydrazine is not an elementary substance but rather a compound.","Use the model to determine whether hydrazine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of hydrazine is composed of four hydrogen atoms and two nitrogen atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that hydrazine is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and nitrogen. Since hydrazine is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, hydrazine is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.

What is the probability that a chicken produced by this cross will be heterozygous for the leg color gene?,"2/4
0/4

1/4",0,0,2/4,"The correct answer is A. 2/4.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, we can see that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the leg color gene in the offspring. The alleles are represented as follows:

- L (white legs)
- l (yellow legs)

The Punnett square shows:
- Top left: LL (white legs)
- Top right: LL (white legs)
- Bottom left: ll (yellow legs)
- Bottom right: ll (yellow legs)

From this, we can see that out of the four possible combinations, two of them (LL and LL) result in white legs, which means they are homozygous dominant. The other two combinations (ll and ll) result in yellow legs, which means they are homozygous recessive. Since the question asks for the probability that a chicken produced by this cross will be heterozygous for the leg color gene, and none of the combinations shown are heterozygous (heterozygous would be Ll), the probability is 0/4. However, if the question was asking for the probability of getting either a white or yellow legged chicken, then the probability would be 2/4 (50%) for each, since half of the offspring will have white legs and half will have yellow legs. But based on the specific question asked about being heterozygous, the correct answer is 0/4.","2/4.

But based on the specific question asked about being heterozygous, the correct answer is 0/4.","Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.2110289940480172,0.0305233673777706,0.314410475357068,0.2444444444444444,8

Explanation: The Western Alps formed at a convergent boundary because the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate were moving toward each other and collided. When two tectonic plates collide, they push against each other and can cause the land to rise, forming mountains. This is what happened in the case of the Western Alps, where the collision between the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate led to the formation of this mountain range.","convergent.

When two tectonic plates collide, they push against each other and can cause the land to rise, forming mountains. This is what happened in the case of the Western Alps, where the collision between the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate led to the formation of this mountain range.","To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Western Alps, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
Millions of years ago, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate began to move toward each other, eventually colliding. This plate motion formed many mountain ranges, including the Western Alps. The Western Alps run through European countries, including France, Italy, and Switzerland.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Western Alps formed as the two plates collided, or ran into each other. For two plates to collide, they must be moving toward each other. So, the Western Alps formed at a convergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
One type of convergent boundary is a continent-continent collision. This type of boundary forms when two plates with continental crust move toward each other. The collision compresses and folds the continental crust, forcing it upward to form a mountain range.",0.0809482543710196,0.0293661199493863,0.3742690016155398,0.2363636363636363,8
"What do these two changes have in common?
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
shaking up salad dressing","Both are caused by heating.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.",1,1,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle**: This is a physical change because it involves the separation of particles based on their density without any new substances being formed. The sediment (particles) simply settles due to gravity, which is a physical process.

- **Shaking up salad dressing**: This is also a physical change because it involves mixing ingredients together without any chemical reactions occurring. When you shake salad dressing, you are merely mixing oil and vinegar (or other ingredients), but no new substances are created; they are just being redistributed.

Both processes do not involve the formation of new substances or any chemical reactions, making them both physical changes. Neither process is caused by heating or cooling, so options A and D can be eliminated. Option C is incorrect because there are no chemical changes involved in either scenario.","Both are only physical changes.

Neither process is caused by heating or cooling, so options A and D can be eliminated. Option C is incorrect because there are no chemical changes involved in either scenario.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0931447321885988,0.0305931188601823,0.31275719678843,0.1875,8

The kelp does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the kelp is not a primary consumer.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is a producer, so the kelp bass is a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.

"Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the pea color trait?","yellow peas
green peas",0,0,yellow peas,"The correct answer is A. yellow peas.

Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Genotype and Phenotype Relationship**: The phenotype is the observable physical characteristic of an organism, which in this case is the color of the peas produced by the plant. The genotype refers to the genetic makeup of the organism, which includes the specific alleles it carries.

2. **Allele Dominance**: The problem states that the allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e). This means that if an organism has at least one E allele, it will express the yellow pea phenotype, regardless of whether it also has an e allele.

3. **Heterozygous Genotype**: The plant in question has the genotype Ee. This means it has one dominant allele (E) and one recessive allele (e).

4. **Expression of Phenotype**: Since the E allele is dominant, the presence of even one E allele in the genotype Ee will result in the expression of the yellow pea phenotype. Therefore, the plant with the genotype Ee will produce yellow peas.

Thus, the phenotype of the plant with the genotype Ee is yellow peas.","yellow peas.

Thus, the phenotype of the plant with the genotype Ee is yellow peas.","You need to determine the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the pea color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait must be yellow peas.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0714370316812805,0.0224467533299782,0.3734439787889327,0.2461538461538461,7

What information supports the conclusion that Maddie inherited this trait?,"Maddie's neighbor has green eyes.
Maddie and her biological father wear sunglasses when they go outside.
Maddie has green eyes like her biological mother.",2,2,Maddie has green eyes like her biological mother.,"The correct answer is:

C. Maddie has green eyes like her biological mother.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Maddie inherited a trait, specifically having green eyes. Inheritance refers to the passing on of genetic traits from parents to offspring. Therefore, the most relevant piece of information would be one that directly links Maddie's eye color to her biological mother, as maternal inheritance is a common way for certain traits to be passed down in families.

Option A is irrelevant because it mentions Maddie's neighbor, which does not provide any information about Maddie's genetic traits or her relationship with her mother.

Option B is also irrelevant because wearing sunglasses is a behavior and not a genetic trait. It does not provide any information about Maddie's eye color or her genetic inheritance.

What is the probability that a scarlet rosemallow plant produced by this cross will have white flowers?,"4/4
0/4
3/4
1/4
2/4",4,-1,,"The correct answer is E. 2/4.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, we can see that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the flower color trait in the offspring. The alleles are represented as follows: F (red flowers) and f (white flowers). 

- The top left box shows Ff, which means one parent contributes an F allele and the other contributes an f allele.
- The top right box shows ff, indicating both parents contribute an f allele.
- The bottom left box also shows Ff, similar to the top left box.
- The bottom right box shows ff, again indicating both parents contribute an f allele.

From this Punnett square, we can see that out of the four possible combinations, two of them (Ff and Ff) result in red flowers, while the other two (ff and ff) result in white flowers. Therefore, the probability that a scarlet rosemallow plant produced by this cross will have white flowers is 2 out of 4, or 2/4.",,"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8

B. a hairy body

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for the body hair trait in deer mice has two alleles:
- Allele B is for a hairy body.
- Allele b is for a hairless body.

Remy, a deer mouse, has a hairy body. This means that Remy must have at least one allele for a hairy body (B). Since Remy has one allele for a hairy body and one allele for a hairless body, his genotype would be Bb. However, the question asks for Remy's phenotype, which refers to the observable physical characteristic.

Given that Remy has a hairy body, his phenotype for the body hair trait is ""a hairy body."" The genotype Bb indicates that Remy has one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b), but since the dominant allele (B) results in a hairy body, the phenotype is determined by the dominant trait. Therefore, Remy's phenotype is ""a hairy body.""","a hairy body

So, Remy's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairy body.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

A. euphemism

Explanation:
An euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression used in place of one considered to be harsh, blunt, or offensive. In the given text, ""old news"" is being used as an euphemism for something that has already happened and is no longer newsworthy. The phrase ""That's old news"" implies that Julian's decision to leave his job was not surprising because it had been planned for a long time, making it a matter of routine rather than a recent event.

"Complete the statement. Assume that Caleb's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and Earth () as he rode the escalator.","increased
stayed the same
decreased",0,0,increased,"The correct answer is A. increased.

Explanation:
Gravitational potential energy (PE) is given by the formula \( PE = m \cdot g \cdot h \), where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (usually the ground). Since Caleb's mass did not change, we can focus on how his height relative to the ground changed.

When Caleb rode the escalator from the first floor to the second floor of a shopping mall, his height \( h \) with respect to the ground increased. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and the Earth also increased because the product \( m \cdot g \cdot h \) increases when \( h \) increases.

Thus, the gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and Earth increased as he rode the escalator.","increased.

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and the Earth also increased because the product \( m \cdot g \cdot h \) increases when \( h \) increases.

Thus, the gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and Earth increased as he rode the escalator.","Think about how the distance between Caleb and the center of Earth changed.
The second floor is higher than the first floor. As he rode the escalator toward the second floor, the distance between Caleb and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and Earth increased as he rode the escalator.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

C. The cell wall stores nutrients, water, and waste in a plant cell.

Explanation:

- **A. Lysosomes are the sites where ribosomes build proteins in animal cells.**
  - This statement is incorrect. Ribosomes are the sites where proteins are synthesized in both animal and plant cells. Lysosomes are organelles that contain digestive enzymes and are involved in breaking down cellular debris and recycling materials within the cell. They do not synthesize proteins.

- **B. The endoplasmic reticulum is outside the nucleus in an animal cell.**
  - This statement is incorrect. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an internal membrane-bound organelle found within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, including animal cells. It is not located outside the nucleus but rather is part of the cell's internal structure.

- **C. The cell wall stores nutrients, water, and waste in a plant cell.**
  - This statement is correct. In plant cells, the cell wall is a rigid layer surrounding the cell membrane. While it provides structural support and protection to the cell, it does not store nutrients, water, or waste directly. These functions are primarily carried out by other organelles such as the vacuole, which can store various substances including water, nutrients, and waste products.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample B
sample A",2,2,sample A,"The correct answer is C. sample A.

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle can be calculated using the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is its velocity.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 46 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 1,300 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 26 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 1,200 m/s

Let's calculate the average kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 46 \, \text{u} \times (1,300 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 \, \text{u} \times (1,200 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample A is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample B, and the average speed of the particles in Sample A is also greater, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample A will be higher. Therefore, Sample A has the higher temperature.","sample A.

In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.","The correct answer is:

A. Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.

Explanation: The word ""ironic"" is traditionally used to describe a situation where there is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens, often with a humorous or unexpected twist. In option A, the situation described is ironic because Clarence was trying to escape the cold and snowy weather in Boston by going to Florida, but Florida experienced a rare snowstorm while he was there. This creates a humorous contrast between his intention and the actual outcome, fitting the traditional definition of irony.

In option B, the use of ""ironic"" does not fit the traditional sense of the word. Here, ""ironic"" is used more loosely to describe a twist of fate, which is not necessarily humorous or unexpected in the same way as in option A. It simply describes a coincidence without the element of humor or contrast that is central to the traditional definition of irony.","Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.

Explanation: The word ""ironic"" is traditionally used to describe a situation where there is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens, often with a humorous or unexpected twist. In option A, the situation described is ironic because Clarence was trying to escape the cold and snowy weather in Boston by going to Florida, but Florida experienced a rare snowstorm while he was there. This creates a humorous contrast between his intention and the actual outcome, fitting the traditional definition of irony.

In option B, the use of ""ironic"" does not fit the traditional sense of the word. Here, ""ironic"" is used more loosely to describe a twist of fate, which is not necessarily humorous or unexpected in the same way as in option A. It simply describes a coincidence without the element of humor or contrast that is central to the traditional definition of irony.","The second text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Clarence tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The first text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Clarence's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect.

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample A
sample B
neither; the samples have the same temperature",1,1,sample B,"B. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is its velocity, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 36 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 910 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 44 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 1,000 m/s

Calculating the kinetic energy for each:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 \, \text{u} \times (910 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 44 \, \text{u} \times (1,000 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the average particle speed in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the mass difference between the particles in the two samples is not significant enough to make up for the difference in speed, the higher average speed in Sample B results in a higher average kinetic energy per particle. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

- ""The right hemisphere of the human brain"" - This is the subject of the sentence.
- ""typically controls"" - This is the verb phrase.
- ""muscle movement on the left side of the body"" - This is the object of the verb phrase.

Since there is only one independent clause in the sentence, it is classified as a simple sentence, not a complex sentence.","The sentence is simple. It is a single independent clause.
The right hemisphere of the human brain typically controls muscle movement on the left side of the body.

A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.

"What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a ceramic plate
water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Breaking a ceramic plate** is a physical change because it involves the breaking of solid material without altering its chemical composition. The plate is still made of the same materials (ceramic) but has been physically divided into smaller pieces.

- **Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror** is also a physical change. Condensation occurs when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cooler surface, causing the water molecules to slow down and form liquid droplets. This process does not involve any chemical reaction; it's simply a change in the state of matter from gas to liquid.

Both processes do not involve the formation of new substances or the breaking down of existing ones at the molecular level, which would be characteristic of a chemical change. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes do not involve the formation of new substances or the breaking down of existing ones at the molecular level, which would be characteristic of a chemical change. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes state from gas in the air to liquid water on the mirror. But the water vapor and the liquid water are both made of water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water vapor condensing is caused by cooling. But breaking a ceramic plate is not.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

When Ellen got on her bike, her feet were no longer touching the ground.",0,0,"When Ellen started pedaling her bike, she began moving along the street.","The correct answer is:

A. When Ellen started pedaling her bike, she began moving along the street.

Explanation:
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion. In this scenario, Ellen's kinetic energy changes as she starts to move her bike forward. The fact that she begins moving along the street directly indicates a change in her kinetic energy because she is now in motion, which means she possesses kinetic energy.

Option B, ""When Ellen got on her bike, her feet were no longer touching the ground,"" does not necessarily indicate a change in her kinetic energy. Getting on the bike and having her feet off the ground could be a preparatory action before she starts pedaling and moving. It does not inherently show that her kinetic energy has changed; it only shows a position change relative to the ground.","When Ellen started pedaling her bike, she began moving along the street.

Michelle is in the Air Force. She flies a plane almost every day.
A pilot taught Michelle how to fly a plane.",2,1,Michelle is in the Air Force. She flies a plane almost every day.,"The correct answer is:

B. Michelle is in the Air Force. She flies a plane almost every day.

Explanation:
The trait in question is ""Michelle knows how to fly a plane."" To support this conclusion, we need evidence that directly indicates Michelle has the ability to fly a plane. Option B provides the most direct support for this conclusion because it states that Michelle is in the Air Force and flies a plane almost every day. This implies that she has extensive experience and training in flying planes, which is consistent with knowing how to fly a plane.

Option A, while it might suggest that Michelle has some experience with flying planes, does not provide as strong a basis for concluding that she knows how to fly a plane. It only mentions her ability to fly a plane under certain conditions (cloudy days and at night), but it does not establish that she has the knowledge or skill required to fly a plane in general.

Option C, while it suggests that Michelle has been taught by a pilot, does not necessarily imply that she knows how to fly a plane. The teaching alone does not guarantee that she has learned the necessary skills and knowledge to fly a plane independently.

Explanation: When Rita rode her sled down the hill, the gravitational potential energy (PE) of the sled-Earth system decreased.

As Rita descended the hill, the height \( h \) of the sled relative to the ground decreased, which means the gravitational potential energy also decreased. The mass of the sled did not change, so the decrease in height was the primary factor affecting the change in gravitational potential energy.","Think about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Rita started sledding. As Rita rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Rita rode down the hill.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.

To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

"Based on this information, what is Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?","a spotted coat
a black coat",0,0,a spotted coat,"The correct answer is:

A. a spotted coat

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable physical traits of an organism, while the genotype refers to the genetic makeup of that organism. The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a). This means that if an individual has at least one A allele, they will express the spotted coat phenotype.

Given that Zuri has the heterozygous genotype Aa, she has one dominant allele (A) and one recessive allele (a). Since the dominant allele (A) is for a spotted coat, Zuri will express the spotted coat phenotype regardless of whether she also has the recessive allele (a).

Therefore, Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a spotted coat.","a spotted coat

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable physical traits of an organism, while the genotype refers to the genetic makeup of that organism. The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a). This means that if an individual has at least one A allele, they will express the spotted coat phenotype.

Given that Zuri has the heterozygous genotype Aa, she has one dominant allele (A) and one recessive allele (a). Since the dominant allele (A) is for a spotted coat, Zuri will express the spotted coat phenotype regardless of whether she also has the recessive allele (a).

Therefore, Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a spotted coat.","You need to determine Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Zuri's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Zuri's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0176010101384762,0.0078822878419353,0.3568075076902731,0.1969696969696969,7

Which statement describes the sailboat's motion?,"The sailboat is accelerating.
The sailboat has a constant velocity.",0,0,The sailboat is accelerating.,"The correct answer is:

A. The sailboat is accelerating.

Explanation:
The hint provided states that ""the sailboat is speeding up as a gust of wind catches the sail."" This indicates that the sailboat's speed is increasing over time, which is the definition of acceleration. Acceleration occurs when an object changes its velocity (speed or direction) with respect to time. Since the sailboat is speeding up, it is experiencing positive acceleration in the direction it is moving.

Option B, ""The sailboat has a constant velocity,"" would imply that the sailboat's speed and direction remain unchanged, which contradicts the information given in the hint. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.","The sailboat is accelerating.

Since the allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f), any offspring with at least one F allele will have black fur.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0187686230932184,0.0015990741756209,0.2841530013496969,0.1346153846153846,8

"Based on this information, what is Skip's phenotype for the horns trait?","not having horns

B. having horns

Explanation:
In genetics, the phenotype refers to the observable traits of an organism, such as the presence or absence of horns in this case. The genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which includes the specific alleles it carries.

Given that the allele for having horns (h) is recessive and the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant, we can analyze Skip's genotype (Hh) as follows:

- The dominant allele (H) will mask the effect of the recessive allele (h).
- Since Skip has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h), he will express the dominant trait.

Therefore, Skip's phenotype for the horns trait is ""having horns"" because the dominant allele (H) will result in the expression of the trait associated with that allele.","having horns

Explanation:

- The dominant allele (H) will mask the effect of the recessive allele (h).
- Since Skip has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h), he will express the dominant trait.

Therefore, Skip's phenotype for the horns trait is ""having horns"" because the dominant allele (H) will result in the expression of the trait associated with that allele.","You need to determine Skip's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Skip's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Skip's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Skip's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0230966468384222,0.0075882902918454,0.313901340984134,0.15625,8

**B. Do rubber balloons stick to a cotton blanket or a wooden door longer after being rubbed on his hair?**

Here's the reasoning:

David's curiosity stems from observing how a balloon sticks to a wall after being rubbed on someone's hair. This suggests that static electricity plays a role in the phenomenon. To investigate this further, David needs to focus on comparing two surfaces where the effect of static electricity can be observed.

Given the supplies:
- Hair (from David's head)
- Cotton blanket
- Wooden door
- Five rubber balloons

David can use the hair to generate static electricity by rubbing it on the balloons. Then, he can test the sticking ability of the balloons on both the cotton blanket and the wooden door. This setup allows him to compare the effects of static electricity on two different materials, which aligns with his observation at the magic show.

Option A introduces foil balloons, which are not among the supplies David has. Option C introduces a metal door, which is also not part of the supplies.

1. **Genotype and Phenotype Relationship**: The phenotype is the observable physical characteristic of an organism, which in this case is the body color of the Nile tilapia fish. The genotype refers to the genetic makeup of the organism, which includes the specific alleles it carries.

2. **Allele Information**: The gene for body color has two alleles:

   - \( b \): This allele codes for a pink body, and it is recessive to the \( B \) allele.

3. **Homozygous Genotype**: The question states that the fish in question has the homozygous genotype \( bb \). This means the fish has two copies of the recessive allele \( b \).

4. **Expression of Recessive Alleles**: Since the \( b \) allele is recessive, it will only be expressed if both alleles are \( b \). Therefore, a fish with the genotype \( bb \) will express the pink body color because the \( b \) allele is dominant over itself.

It also specifies that the allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).

Since Blaze has the homozygous genotype hh, both alleles contributing to the horns trait are the recessive allele h.

A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0229620007790518,0.0085978883578375,0.3408071705153934,0.2063492063492063,7
What is the temperature of a bowl of ice cream?,"35°F
35°C",0,1,35°C,"The correct answer is B. 35°C.

Explanation: The temperature of a bowl of ice cream is typically around 35°C (95°F). This is because ice cream is made by freezing milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings to a semi-solid state. When it is served, it is usually at this temperature to maintain its texture and prevent melting too quickly.

The divergent boundary is further supported by the fact that the plates are moving away from each other, as indicated by the labels ""North American Plate"" and ""Eurasian Plate"" on either side of the gap.","To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Thingvellir Rift Valley, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
In Iceland, parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are above sea level. The Thingvellir Rift Valley is one example. This rift valley began to form as the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate moved away from each other. In this picture, you can see the gap that formed during a major plate movement along the rift. Gaps such as this form when the two plates move apart, creating a large crack in the crust. The last time this happened in the Thingvellir Rift Valley was in the spring of 1789. Since then, a walking path was built along the rift valley to allow park visitors to walk along the rift.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed as the two plates moved away from each other, or diverged. So, the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed at a divergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.",0.0664134995670528,0.0289814428440236,0.3644067755587475,0.2,8

So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears.
To check this answer, consider whether Pepe's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Pepe's genotype of EE has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0038241999472835,0.00182319740253,0.3009708700607975,0.1969696969696969,8

Flopsy's observable version of the fur length trait is long fur. So, Flopsy's phenotype for the fur length trait is long fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

a dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **A penny tarnishing**: This process involves the oxidation of copper in the penny, which is a chemical reaction where copper reacts with oxygen to form copper oxide (CuO). This change is not reversible without special conditions and results in a different substance from the original copper.

- **A dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years**: This process is known as fossilization or petrification. It involves the replacement of organic material (like bones) with minerals such as silica, calcite, or pyrite. This transformation is also a chemical change because it involves the replacement of one substance with another, altering the composition of the original material.

Both processes involve chemical reactions that result in the formation of new substances, making them both chemical changes rather than physical changes. Cooling and heating are not directly involved in these processes; instead, they are more related to the environmental conditions under which these changes occur.","Both are chemical changes.

Both processes involve chemical reactions that result in the formation of new substances, making them both chemical changes rather than physical changes. Cooling and heating are not directly involved in these processes; instead, they are more related to the environmental conditions under which these changes occur.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
A dinosaur bone turning into rock is a chemical change. The matter that made up the bone when it was alive begins to break down. Over a long time, a different type of matter starts forming inside small gaps in the bone. The matter is made of minerals from the earth.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

Explanation: The excerpt provided is quite straightforward and lacks the personal touch and vividness that can be achieved through the use of dialogue. Dialogue can bring the narrative to life by providing direct quotes from characters, which can make the story more engaging and relatable. By adding dialogue, the writer can capture the emotions and reactions of the characters more effectively, making the reader feel like they are part of the scene. For example, the writer could add lines such as ""Wyatt winced in pain,"" ""Coach Carey's face turned concerned,"" or ""Wyatt whispered, 'I'm scared I won't be able to pitch again.'""

During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?",0.1546295205087134,0.0233344843284333,0.1824104185907544,0.1149425287356321,11

A. The supply will probably go down.

Explanation:
When the factories that produce cough drops in Fairfax are destroyed by floods, it directly impacts the production capacity of the company. Since these factories are significant producers of cough drops, their destruction means that less of the product can be manufactured.

3. **Phenotype Expression**: Since the dominant allele (D) is present in the genotype, the plant will express the dominant trait. The dominant trait here is green pods.

Therefore, the phenotype of this plant for the pod color trait is green pods.","The pea plant's genotype for the pod color gene is DD. The pea plant's genotype of DD has only D allelles. The D allele is for green pods. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D). This means D is a dominant allele, and d is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of DD has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

Since silver does not have any other elements combined with it, it is classified as an elementary substance.","You can tell whether silver is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for silver is Ag. This formula contains one symbol: Ag. So, the formula tells you that silver is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, silver is an elementary substance.

Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.",0.0243694793414964,0.0040602803473524,0.3425414316730259,0.2954545454545454,7

"Based on this information, what is Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait?","black fur
brown fur",1,1,brown fur,"The correct answer is B. brown fur.

Explanation:
In the given scenario, the gene for fur color in rabbits has two alleles: F (black fur) and f (brown fur). The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (ff) to express the brown fur phenotype.

Ringo is described as having the homozygous genotype ff. Since the allele for brown fur (f) is recessive, Ringo will express the brown fur phenotype because he has two copies of the recessive allele.

Therefore, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait is brown fur.","brown fur.

Explanation:
In the given scenario, the gene for fur color in rabbits has two alleles: F (black fur) and f (brown fur). The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (ff) to express the brown fur phenotype.

Ringo is described as having the homozygous genotype ff. Since the allele for brown fur (f) is recessive, Ringo will express the brown fur phenotype because he has two copies of the recessive allele.

Therefore, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait is brown fur.","Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Ringo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for brown fur. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Ringo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Ringo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0071798294327322,0.003143166782486,0.3414634106631767,0.1904761904761904,7

Explanation:
The phrase ""between jobs"" is a euphemism that typically indicates that someone is not currently employed and is looking for work or has recently lost their job. It suggests that Ava is not actively working at the moment but is in a transitional period where she is seeking employment. The context provided also supports this interpretation because it mentions that she is selling old jewelry to help pay the bills, which implies financial need, often associated with unemployment or being out of work.

Cells that become sperm are found inside the pollen.
Eggs are female cells. The eggs are produced and stored in the ovary.

Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff

"Based on this information, what is Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait?","having Thomsen disease
not having Thomsen disease",1,1,not having Thomsen disease,"The correct answer is B. not having Thomsen disease.

Explanation:
- The gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles: M (dominant) and m (recessive).
- The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m).
- Elijah has the homozygous genotype mm for the Thomsen disease gene.
- Since the recessive allele (m) is present twice (mm), Elijah does not have the dominant allele (M) that would express the trait of having Thomsen disease.
- Therefore, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait is not having Thomsen disease.","not having Thomsen disease.

Explanation:
- The gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles: M (dominant) and m (recessive).
- The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m).
- Elijah has the homozygous genotype mm for the Thomsen disease gene.
- Since the recessive allele (m) is present twice (mm), Elijah does not have the dominant allele (M) that would express the trait of having Thomsen disease.
- Therefore, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait is not having Thomsen disease.","Elijah's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm. Elijah's genotype of mm has only m alleles. The m allele is for not having Thomsen disease. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease.
To check this answer, consider whether Elijah's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m). This means M is a dominant allele, and m is a recessive allele.
Elijah's genotype of mm has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.",0.0037090527378759,0.0021561562330959,0.3076923042545694,0.203125,8

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, both parents are heterozygous for the Bekko pattern trait (Bb).

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0134747128136137,0.0021000349352161,0.2417582376766091,0.1538461538461538,8

In this context, ""literally"" is used in its traditional sense, meaning ""in fact"" or ""actually."" The sentence states that the bridge is hundreds of years old, which is a factual statement about the age of the Rialto Bridge. Therefore, using ""literally"" here means that the bridge is actually hundreds of years old, which aligns with the traditional usage of the word.

In contrast, option B uses ""literally"" in a hyperbolic or figurative sense, suggesting that the bridge is a million years old, which is not a factual statement and is an exaggeration for emphasis. This usage deviates from the traditional sense of ""literally,"" which would imply actuality rather than exaggeration.","In this context, ""literally"" is used in its traditional sense, meaning ""in fact"" or ""actually.""

"Using only these supplies, which question can Whitney investigate with an experiment?","Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted in small pots or in large pots?
If squash seeds and tomato seeds are planted with compost, which type of plant grows larger?
Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?",2,2,Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?,"The correct answer for Whitney's experiment is:

C. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?

Here’s the reasoning:

Whitney's observation suggests that there might be a difference in growth between squash plants near the compost pile and those farther away. This indicates that compost could be influencing the growth of the squash plants. Given the supplies she has (squash seeds, four large clay pots, soil, a compost pile, water), she can set up an experiment to test whether the presence of compost affects the growth of squash plants.

To conduct this experiment, Whitney can:
1. Plant squash seeds in two sets of two pots each.
2. Plant one set of two pots with compost in them.
3. Plant the other set of two pots without compost.
4. Ensure all pots receive the same amount of water and are kept under similar conditions (light, temperature, etc.).

By comparing the growth of the squash plants in the pots with compost versus those without, Whitney can determine if compost has a significant effect on plant growth. This aligns well with the supplies she has and directly addresses the question of whether compost influences plant size.

Options A and B involve additional variables not present in Whitney's supplies (small pots vs. large pots, different types of seeds). Therefore, option C is the most suitable choice for Whitney's experiment based on the given supplies and her initial observations.","Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?

"What do these two changes have in common?
deep-frying chicken
burning a marshmallow over a campfire","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.",1,1,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is B. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Deep-frying chicken** involves cooking the chicken in hot oil, which causes a chemical reaction where the fat in the chicken breaks down and mixes with the oil, creating new compounds. This process also involves the Maillard reaction, a complex series of chemical reactions that occur when amino acids and reducing sugars react at high temperatures, leading to the browning and flavor development of the chicken.

- **Burning a marshmallow over a campfire** is another example of a chemical change. When a marshmallow is heated, it undergoes thermal decomposition, breaking down into simpler substances like carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The sugar in the marshmallow caramelizes, changing its color and texture due to the Maillard reaction, similar to what happens during deep-frying.

Both processes involve chemical changes because they result in the formation of new substances from the original materials (the chicken and the marshmallow). Physical changes, on the other hand, would not involve the creation of new substances but might include changes in state or appearance without altering the fundamental composition of the materials. Cooling is not a factor in either of these processes; rather, heat is used to initiate the chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.196053855507966,0.022374265862039,0.2222222172250568,0.2407407407407407,8

What information supports the conclusion that Gavin inherited this trait?,"Gavin and his biological father have short hair.
Gavin's biological mother often wears her naturally brown hair in a bun.
Gavin and his siblings all have naturally straight hair.",1,0,Gavin and his biological father have short hair.,"The correct answer is:

A. Gavin and his biological father have short hair.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Gavin inherited a trait, specifically the color of his hair (naturally brown). Inheritance typically refers to traits passed from parents to offspring through genes. 

- Option A suggests that Gavin and his biological father both have short hair. This could imply a genetic link because if they share the same trait (short hair), it might suggest that they inherited it from a common ancestor or that the gene for short hair is present in their lineage. However, this does not directly support the inheritance of the naturally brown hair trait.

- Option B mentions that Gavin's biological mother often wears her naturally brown hair in a bun. This information tells us about the mother's hair color but does not provide evidence of how Gavin inherited his hair color. It only indicates that she has naturally brown hair, which could be relevant if she is the source of the trait, but it doesn't confirm that Gavin inherited it from her.

- Option C states that Gavin and his siblings all have naturally straight hair. While this could indicate a genetic pattern within the family, it does not specifically address the inheritance of the naturally brown hair trait. It only provides information about another trait (hair texture) that may or may not be related to the hair color trait.

Therefore, the most direct evidence supporting the conclusion that Gavin inherited the naturally brown hair trait would be if he and his biological father shared the same hair color, as indicated in option A. This would suggest a genetic link between them regarding hair color.","Gavin and his biological father have short hair.

Explanation:

Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. It is given by the formula \( GPE = m \cdot g \cdot h \), where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the ground).

In the scenario described, the skydiver is drifting downward towards the ground. As she moves closer to the ground, her height \( h \) decreases. Since the mass \( m \) of the skydiver does not change, the decrease in height directly leads to a decrease in gravitational potential energy.

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the skydiver and Earth decreases as she drifts toward the flat ground.","Think about how the distance between the skydiver and the center of Earth changed.
The ground was lower than the point where the skydiver opened up her parachute. As she drifted toward the ground, the distance between the skydiver and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the skydiver and Earth decreased as she drifted toward the flat ground.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

A. the Bible

Explanation:
The phrase ""Good Samaritan"" comes from the biblical parable found in Luke 10:25-37, also known as the Parable of the Good Samaritan. In this story, a man is left for dead on the side of the road after being robbed and beaten by bandits. A Samaritan, who was considered an enemy to the Jews at the time, stops to help the injured man, showing compassion and providing aid. This act of kindness is used as a metaphor for someone who helps others without expecting anything in return.

The term ""Good Samaritan"" has since become a common expression in English to describe a person who helps others in need, regardless of their relationship or social standing. The allusion in the given sentence refers to a person who helped the speaker when they needed assistance with their groceries, much like the Good Samaritan in the biblical story.","the Bible

Explanation:
The phrase ""Good Samaritan"" comes from the biblical parable found in Luke 10:25-37, also known as the Parable of the Good Samaritan. In this story, a man is left for dead on the side of the road after being robbed and beaten by bandits. A Samaritan, who was considered an enemy to the Jews at the time, stops to help the injured man, showing compassion and providing aid. This act of kindness is used as a metaphor for someone who helps others without expecting anything in return.

The text states three pieces of evidence to support the conclusion that the client is innocent. However, each piece of evidence essentially restates the conclusion in different words. For example:
- ""She has not done anything wrong"" is essentially saying the same as ""she is innocent.""
- ""She is not guilty"" is another way of saying ""she is innocent.""
- ""She is free from all criminal behaviors, dispositions, or inclinations"" is also a rephrasing of ""she is innocent.""

This repetition of the conclusion within the premises is a classic example of circular reasoning.

"What do these two changes have in common?
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon
a dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years","Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.",0,0,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is A. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

1. **Using Polish to Remove Tarnish from a Silver Spoon**: 
   - Tarnish on a silver spoon is primarily due to the formation of a layer of copper sulfide (Cu2S) on the surface of the silver. This occurs when silver reacts with sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is often present in the air, especially in industrial areas or near coal-burning power plants. The process involves a chemical reaction where the silver is oxidized to form tarnish. Removing this tarnish typically involves a chemical reaction as well, such as using a chemical solution that can dissolve the tarnish without damaging the silver underneath. Therefore, this is a chemical change.

2. **A Dinosaur Bone Turning into Rock Over Millions of Years**:
   - This process is known as fossilization or petrification. It involves the replacement of organic material (like bones) with minerals over time. This transformation is a chemical change because it involves the breakdown of the original organic material and its replacement with minerals like silica, calcite, or pyrite. The process is slow and involves chemical reactions that occur over geological timescales.

Both processes involve chemical changes, not just physical changes. Physical changes would involve a change in state or appearance without altering the fundamental composition of the substance. Cooling and heating are not directly involved in either of these processes. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Both are chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

Both processes involve chemical changes, not just physical changes. Physical changes would involve a change in state or appearance without altering the fundamental composition of the substance. Cooling and heating are not directly involved in either of these processes. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Both are chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
A dinosaur bone turning into rock is a chemical change. The matter that made up the bone when it was alive begins to break down. Over a long time, a different type of matter starts forming inside small gaps in the bone. The matter is made of minerals from the earth.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.2045732389079537,0.0318999301638842,0.2499999950154321,0.2916666666666667,7

A. This ecosystem has:
- a small amount of rain or snow
- dry, thin soil
- long, cold winters

**Explanation:**

A cold desert ecosystem, also known as an arctic tundra or polar desert, is characterized by extremely cold temperatures, particularly during winter months, and very little precipitation. Here's why option A correctly describes this type of ecosystem:

1. **Small Amount of Rain or Snow:** Cold deserts receive very little rainfall or snowfall, typically less than 250 mm per year. This is due to the cold air which cannot hold much moisture.

2. **Dry, Thin Soil:** The soil in these regions is often thin and nutrient-poor because of the slow decomposition of organic matter in the cold climate. The permafrost layer (permanently frozen ground) further restricts plant growth and nutrient cycling.

3. **Long, Cold Winters:** These ecosystems experience long, harsh winters with temperatures often dropping below freezing for extended periods. Summers are short and cool, but they can be relatively warmer compared to the winter.

Options B and C do not accurately describe a cold desert ecosystem:

- **Option B:** Describes a temperate deciduous forest or a boreal forest, which experiences warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, and has soil that is rich in nutrients. This does not match the characteristics of a cold desert.

14 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air
21 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air",2,2,21 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air,"The correct answer is C. 21 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.

Explanation: The map uses contour lines to represent specific humidity levels in grams of water vapor per kilogram of air. The outlined area in the image is located over the Amazon Basin, which is known for its high humidity. The contour lines in this region are closest to the 21 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air mark on the color scale at the bottom of the map.

Therefore, the specific humidity level measured within the outlined area is approximately 21 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.","Look at the colors shown within the outlined area. Then, use the legend to determine which specific humidity levels those colors represent.
The legend tells you that this air mass contained air with specific humidity levels between 18 and 24 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air.
21 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air is within this range.
12 and 14 grams of water vapor per kilogram of air are outside of this range.

To study air masses, scientists can use maps that show conditions within Earth's atmosphere. For example, the map below uses color to show specific humidity, a measurement of the amount of water vapor in the air.
The map's legend tells you the specific humidity level that each color represents. Colors on the left in the legend represent lower specific humidity levels than colors on the right.

What is the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth? Choose the most likely ratio.,"2:2
0:4
1:3
3:1
4:0",0,2,1:3,"The correct answer is C. 1:3.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, we can see the possible combinations of alleles for the growth pattern trait when two heterozygous parents (Gg) are crossed. The alleles G (climbing growth) and g (bush growth) are present. 

- The top row represents the alleles from one parent: G and g.
- The left column represents the alleles from the other parent: g and g.

The resulting genotypes for the offspring are as follows:
- Gg (climbing growth) appears twice.
- gg (bush growth) appears twice.

Therefore, the ratio of offspring with climbing growth (Gg) to those with bush growth (gg) is 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. However, since the question asks for the most likely ratio based on the given options, the closest match is 1:3, which implies that there might be a slight error in the options provided or an additional factor not accounted for in the Punnett square. Given the standard Mendelian inheritance, the correct ratio should be 1:1, but if we must choose from the given options, 1:3 is the closest.","1:3.

Given the standard Mendelian inheritance, the correct ratio should be 1:1, but if we must choose from the given options, 1:3 is the closest.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1048456231573235,0.025953440112564,0.2700421891484627,0.24,8

This version eliminates the ambiguity by making it clear that Bill is the one who had trouble comprehending calculus.","Bill went on to calculus after studying trigonometry, but he never fully comprehended calculus.

Explanation: In this sentence, ""he"" could refer to either Bill or someone else who is not mentioned in the sentence. This creates a vague pronoun reference because it is not clear who ""he"" is supposed to represent. The sentence would be clearer if it specified which person was having difficulty comprehending calculus. For example, it could be rewritten as:

What can happen to a sperm and an egg?,"They can turn into spores.
They can fuse and form fertilized eggs.",1,1,They can fuse and form fertilized eggs.,"The correct answer is B. They can fuse and form fertilized eggs.

Explanation: In the context of the life cycle of a moss plant shown in the diagram, sperm and eggs are involved in sexual reproduction. The diagram indicates that sperm cells are produced by the male part of the moss plant (which is not explicitly labeled but can be inferred from the presence of sperm). These sperm cells are released into the environment and can swim through water to reach the female part of the moss plant, where they fertilize the eggs. The fertilized eggs then develop into spores, which eventually germinate and grow into new adult moss plants, completing the life cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is B.","They can fuse and form fertilized eggs.

The new stalk may make spores, but the sperm and the egg do not turn into spores.

Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Moss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.
The sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.
The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.
When the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again.",0.2415130781080533,0.0342002061193552,0.4242424192955005,0.3636363636363636,7

"What do these two changes have in common?
melting wax
rain forming in a cloud","Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are only physical changes.",3,3,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is D. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Melting wax**: This is a physical change because it involves the transition of wax from a solid to a liquid state without any change in its chemical composition. The wax molecules simply rearrange themselves, changing from a solid structure to a more fluid one.

- **Rain forming in a cloud**: This is also a physical change. When water vapor condenses into liquid droplets within a cloud, it forms rain. This process does not involve the formation of new substances; it's merely a phase change from gas (water vapor) to liquid (raindrops).

Both processes do not involve the breaking down or forming of new chemical bonds, which would be necessary for a chemical change. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Both are only physical changes.

Both processes do not involve the breaking down or forming of new chemical bonds, which would be necessary for a chemical change. Therefore, they are both classified as physical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Rain begins to form when water vapor in the air becomes liquid water. This is caused by cooling. But melting wax is not.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

The fruit fly's observable version of the eye color trait is brown eyes. So, the fly's phenotype for the eye color trait is brown eyes.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
sample A
neither; the samples have the same temperature",0,0,sample B,"A. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a substance is related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle can be calculated using the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is its velocity.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (m_A) = 28 u
- Average particle speed (v_A) = 1,100 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (m_B) = 32 u
- Average particle speed (v_B) = 1,300 m/s

Let's calculate the average kinetic energy for each sample:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = 0.5 \times 28 \, \text{u} \times (1,100 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = 0.5 \times 32 \, \text{u} \times (1,300 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the average particle speed in Sample B is also greater, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.

Mary's Boutique claims to have ""something for everyone,"" but it is generally understood that their target market is women of a certain age.","euphemism
oxymoron",0,1,oxymoron,"The correct answer is B. oxymoron.

An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms. In this case, the phrase ""something for everyone"" is not an oxymoron because it does not combine two contradictory terms; rather, it suggests a wide variety of items available at the boutique. However, the statement ""but it is generally understood that their target market is women of a certain age"" implies that while the boutique claims to cater to all customers (""something for everyone""), its actual focus is more specific (""women of a certain age""). This contrast between the broad claim and the narrower reality can be seen as a form of irony or a contradiction, which is often associated with oxymorons when discussing the discrepancy between stated intentions and actual practices.

An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory or seemingly opposite terms. In this case, the phrase ""something for everyone"" is not an oxymoron because it does not combine two contradictory terms; rather, it suggests a wide variety of items available at the boutique. However, the statement ""but it is generally understood that their target market is women of a certain age"" implies that while the boutique claims to cater to all customers (""something for everyone""), its actual focus is more specific (""women of a certain age""). This contrast between the broad claim and the narrower reality can be seen as a form of irony or a contradiction, which is often associated with oxymorons when discussing the discrepancy between stated intentions and actual practices.

"Complete the statement.
Sodium chloride is ().","an elementary substance
a compound",1,1,a compound,"The correct answer is B. a compound.

Explanation:
Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a chemical compound because it consists of two different elements bonded together. Specifically, it is composed of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). In a compound, the atoms of different elements are chemically combined in a fixed ratio. The chemical formula NaCl indicates that one atom of sodium is bonded to one atom of chlorine, which is characteristic of a compound.

An elementary substance, on the other hand, is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Examples of elementary substances include elements like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), or iron (Fe). Since sodium chloride is made up of two different elements, it does not fit the definition of an elementary substance.","a compound.

Examples of elementary substances include elements like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), or iron (Fe). Since sodium chloride is made up of two different elements, it does not fit the definition of an elementary substance.","You can tell whether sodium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for sodium chloride, NaCl, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that sodium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since sodium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium chloride is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.",0.0391391790534316,0.0065867504686291,0.3943661924926712,0.3035714285714285,8

Explanation: The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a pine tree, showing how seeds develop from fertilized cones.

Pollen grows inside male cones, not fertilized cones.

Gymnosperms are plants that have seeds but not flowers. Conifers are a type of a gymnosperm. Instead of flowers, conifers have cones. Conifers use their cones for sexual reproduction.
Most conifer trees have both male and female cones. The male cones produce pollen. The female cones produce eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the cone.
Male cones release pollen into the wind. Pollination happens when pollen lands on and sticks to the female cones. Self-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on the same tree. Cross-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on a different tree.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs at the base of the female cone's scales. This is called fertilization.
The fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures. They can be carried long distances by the wind. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.

Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The wood fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the palm leaf fossil. So, the wood fossil is most likely older than the palm leaf fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

Explanation: Plagioclase is a mineral because it meets the criteria for being classified as such. Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a fixed chemical composition and a crystalline structure. The properties listed in the hint (white streak, fixed crystal structure, pure substance, naturally occurring, not made by organisms, solid) all align with these definitions. Rocks, on the other hand, are aggregates of one or more minerals and do not have a fixed chemical composition. Therefore, plagioclase fits the definition of a mineral.","mineral.

Rocks, on the other hand, are aggregates of one or more minerals and do not have a fixed chemical composition. Therefore, plagioclase fits the definition of a mineral.","Plagioclase has all the properties of a mineral. So, plagioclase is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

Pedro bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Oakdale.",0,0,Pedro custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Oakdale.,"The correct answer is:

A. Pedro custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Oakdale.

Explanation: The word ""unique"" traditionally refers to something that is one of a kind, having no equal or match, and is not duplicated. In this context, when Pedro custom orders a coffee table from a master craftsman, it implies that the coffee table is likely one-of-a-kind or has distinctive features that make it stand out as special, which aligns with the traditional meaning of ""unique.""

On the other hand, option B suggests that Pedro bought a coffee table from a factory outlet store, which typically implies that the items sold there are mass-produced and may not be one-of-a-kind.

dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas","Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.",0,0,Both are only physical changes.,"The correct answer is A. Both are only physical changes.

Explanation:

- **Crushing a mineral into powder**: This process involves breaking down a solid mineral into smaller pieces without altering its chemical composition. The mineral remains the same substance, just in a different form (from a larger to a smaller particle size). This is a physical change because no new substances are formed.

- **Dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas**: Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When it sublimates, it changes directly from a solid to a gas without passing through the liquid phase. This process does not involve any chemical reaction; it's simply a change in state of matter. Therefore, this is also a physical change.

Both processes described do not involve the formation of new substances or any chemical reactions, which makes them both physical changes. They do not involve heating or cooling as a cause, so options B and D can be eliminated. Option C is incorrect because chemical changes involve the formation of new substances, which is not the case here.","Both are only physical changes.

They do not involve heating or cooling as a cause, so options B and D can be eliminated. Option C is incorrect because chemical changes involve the formation of new substances, which is not the case here.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But crushing a mineral is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.1453800990257535,0.0381360038102331,0.3770491754138672,0.3050847457627119,7

When she was younger, Angie wore ribbons in her naturally black hair.",1,1,Both of Angie's biological parents have naturally black hair.,"The correct answer is B. Both of Angie's biological parents have naturally black hair.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Angie inherited a trait, specifically that she has naturally black hair. The trait in question here is the color of hair, which is typically determined by genetic factors passed down from parents.

Option A does not support the conclusion because it discusses how some people use a hair dryer to straighten their hair, which is unrelated to the genetic inheritance of hair color.

Option B directly supports the conclusion because if both of Angie's biological parents have naturally black hair, it is likely that Angie inherited the gene responsible for naturally black hair from them. This is a strong indication that Angie's naturally black hair is an inherited trait.

Option C is irrelevant to the question as it talks about Angie wearing ribbons in her hair when she was younger, which does not provide any information about the genetic basis of her hair color.

Therefore, option B provides the most relevant and supportive information for the conclusion that Angie inherited the trait of having naturally black hair.","Both of Angie's biological parents have naturally black hair.

B. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences

Explanation:
The statement ""You should never let someone borrow something from you. If you do, then everyone will just start taking your things without asking!"" suggests that allowing one person to borrow something will inevitably lead to a chain reaction where everyone starts taking things without permission. This is a classic example of the slippery slope fallacy, where a small initial action is assumed to lead to a series of increasingly severe outcomes.

Let's break it down:
- The initial action is letting someone borrow something.
- The extreme consequence assumed is that everyone will start taking things without asking.

This leap from a single instance to a widespread behavior is not logically sound and is an exaggeration of the potential outcomes. It assumes that one small act will have a domino effect leading to a much more severe situation, which is not necessarily true.","slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences

B. Perry's biological mother often wears her naturally brown hair in a bun.
- This statement describes how Perry's mother styles her hair but does not provide any information about the color of her hair or whether she has naturally brown hair. It also does not indicate anything about Perry inheriting the trait from his mother.

C. Perry and his siblings all have naturally straight hair.
- This information indicates that Perry and his siblings share a trait related to hair texture (straight hair), but it does not provide any information about the color of their hair. Therefore, it cannot support the conclusion that Perry inherited the trait of naturally brown hair.

Given the hint that Perry has naturally brown hair, the most relevant piece of information that supports the conclusion that Perry inherited this trait would be if there was a direct genetic link to the color of his hair. Choice A, which mentions that Perry and his biological father have short hair, does not provide such a link to the color of their hair. 

However, if we were to assume that the trait of naturally brown hair is a dominant trait and that Perry's father also has naturally brown hair, then this could be a reasonable inference. But based on the given choices and the information provided, the best answer is:

Explanation:
In genetics, the term ""genotype"" refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, which includes all the genes it possesses. The question states that the gene for coat color in horses has two alleles: L (for a black coat) and l (for a reddish-brown coat). Since Boxer has a black coat, we know that he must have at least one L allele because L is dominant over l. Additionally, the question specifies that Boxer has one allele for a black coat and one allele for a reddish-brown coat. This means that Boxer's genotype must be heterozygous, with one L allele and one l allele. Therefore, the genotype for Boxer is Ll.","Ll.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

Option B, ""failed,"" does not use personification because it describes the outcome of the attempt to start the car but does not attribute any human-like action to the car engine itself. Therefore, option A is the correct choice for completing the sentence using personification.","""coughed.""

Explanation: Personification is a literary device where human characteristics are attributed to non-human entities. In this context, the car engine is being given a human-like action of coughing, which suggests that the engine is struggling or having difficulty starting due to the cold weather. This choice effectively personifies the car engine by attributing a human action (coughing) to it.

Option B, ""failed,"" does not use personification because it describes the outcome of the attempt to start the car but does not attribute any human-like action to the car engine itself. Therefore, option A is the correct choice for completing the sentence using personification.","Complete the sentence with the word coughed. It describes the engine as if it were a person who is sick.

Personification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things. It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.

Carly has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny.",0,1,"Carly has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny.","The correct answer is B. ""Carly has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny.""

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" in the second part of the sentence could refer to either Carly or Jenny. This creates ambiguity because it's not clear which of the two individuals has pierced ears. The use of ""otherwise"" suggests that there might be some differences between the two, but without specifying who ""she"" refers to, the sentence is unclear.

In contrast, option A clearly specifies that Carly has pierced ears, so there is no ambiguity about who ""she"" refers to in that sentence.","""Carly has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny.""

Carly looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny, but she has pierced ears.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Carly has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny.

When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

The diagram illustrates that spores are the reproductive units of ferns, and they can germinate and grow into new plants, including the heart-shaped plant stage before becoming a mature fern again.","Unlike sperm and eggs, spores do not fuse.
After they are released, spores can land on the ground and germinate. When a spore germinates, it grows into a heart-shaped plant.

Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, all four boxes contain the genotype ""LI,"" which means that both parents are heterozygous (Ll). When two heterozygous individuals (Ll x Ll) are crossed, the possible genotypes of their offspring can be predicted using a Punnett square. The possible combinations are:

- LL (homozygous dominant)
- Ll (heterozygous)
- Ll (heterozygous)
- Ll (heterozygous)

Since there are four possible outcomes and only one of them (LL) is homozygous dominant, the probability of producing a homozygous dominant offspring is 1 out of 4, or 1/4.","1/4.

- Ll (heterozygous)

Since there are four possible outcomes and only one of them (LL) is homozygous dominant, the probability of producing a homozygous dominant offspring is 1 out of 4, or 1/4.","Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0316996740889153,0.0046456982002157,0.3152173867349953,0.2666666666666666,8

"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 1,000 times that of Earth.","false
true",1,1,true,"B. true

To determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Earth.

The volume of Jupiter is given as \(1.43 \times 10^{15} \, \text{km}^3\).
The volume of Earth is given as \(1.08 \times 10^{12} \, \text{km}^3\).

First, let's express these volumes in a comparable form. We can do this by dividing Jupiter's volume by Earth's volume:

\[
\frac{1.43 \times 10^{15}}{1.08 \times 10^{12}} = \frac{1.43}{1.08} \times 10^{15-12} = 1.32 \times 10^3 \approx 1320
\]

This calculation shows that Jupiter's volume is approximately 1320 times that of Earth. Since 1320 is more than 1,000, the statement ""Jupiter's volume is more than 1,000 times that of Earth"" is true.","true

To determine if the statement is true or false, we need to compare the volumes of Jupiter and Earth.

The volume of Jupiter is given as \(1.43 \times 10^{15} \, \text{km}^3\).

Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. The volume of Jupiter is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is more than 1.08 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is more than 1,000 times that of Earth.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)

Explanation: Guide words in a dictionary are used to help locate a specific word quickly. They appear at the top of each page and indicate the range of words that can be found on that page. The guide words ""gale"" and ""giraffe"" suggest that the page contains words starting with letters between G and I, inclusive. The word ""gravy"" starts with the letter G, which falls within this range. Therefore, if ""gravy"" were present in the dictionary, it would likely be found on a page where ""gale"" and ""giraffe"" are the guide words. However, since ""gravy"" does not start with a letter between G and I, it would not be found on a page with these guide words.","no.

Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits.

Solution A",0,1,neither; their concentrations are the same,"B. neither; their concentrations are the same

Explanation: Concentration is defined as the amount of solute (green particles) in a given volume of solvent (solution). In both Solution A and Solution B, there are 9 green particles in 45 mL of solvent. Therefore, the concentration of green particles in both solutions is the same.","neither; their concentrations are the same

Explanation: Concentration is defined as the amount of solute (green particles) in a given volume of solvent (solution). In both Solution A and Solution B, there are 9 green particles in 45 mL of solvent. Therefore, the concentration of green particles in both solutions is the same.","In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0496833089213377,0.0136054905435418,0.3193277268074289,0.2333333333333333,7

Both are only physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **A piece of avocado turning brown**: This is a chemical change because it involves the oxidation of the avocado's flesh, which is a reaction with oxygen in the air that causes the color change from green to brown. This process is not reversible without special treatments like antioxidants or freezing.

- **Boiling sugar to make caramel**: This is also a chemical change. When sugar is heated, it undergoes a series of chemical reactions (decomposition and polymerization) that result in the formation of new compounds, leading to the characteristic caramel color and flavor. This transformation cannot be reversed to return the sugar to its original state.

Both processes involve chemical reactions that alter the substance's properties permanently, making them chemical changes rather than physical ones. Neither can be reversed without additional intervention, such as using specific chemicals or techniques to reverse the oxidation or decomposition processes.","Both are chemical changes.

Both processes involve chemical reactions that alter the substance's properties permanently, making them chemical changes rather than physical ones. Neither can be reversed without additional intervention, such as using specific chemicals or techniques to reverse the oxidation or decomposition processes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.087013537863841,0.0220998685489022,0.2845188235990266,0.234375,8

The gravitational potential energy stored between the hockey puck and Earth () as the puck slid toward the goal.","increased
stayed the same

Explanation: Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy an object possesses due to its position relative to a reference point, typically the ground or another object. The formula for GPE is given by:

\[ \text{GPE} = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above the reference point.

In this scenario, the hockey puck is sliding toward the goal, which means it is moving closer to the ground. As the puck moves downward, its height \( h \) decreases. Since the mass \( m \) of the puck does not change, the decrease in height directly leads to a decrease in gravitational potential energy.

Therefore, as the puck slides toward the goal, its gravitational potential energy stored between the puck and the Earth decreases.","decreased.

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above the reference point.

Since the mass \( m \) of the puck does not change, the decrease in height directly leads to a decrease in gravitational potential energy.

Therefore, as the puck slides toward the goal, its gravitational potential energy stored between the puck and the Earth decreases.","Think about how the distance between the hockey puck and the center of Earth changed.
Because the table was level, each point on the table was the same distance from the center of Earth. As the hockey puck slid toward the goal, the distance between the puck and the center of Earth stayed the same. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the hockey puck and Earth stayed the same as the puck slid toward the goal.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.

In option B, the word ""unique"" is used to describe each individual item (vase and bowl) in Ashley's collection. Here, ""unique"" refers to the individual characteristics of each piece rather than describing Ashley herself. This usage is more aligned with the modern, colloquial use of the word ""unique,"" where it can mean distinctive or special but not necessarily one-of-a-kind in the absolute sense.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, the alleles for the coat pattern trait are represented as A (solid coloring) and a (white spots). The Punnett square shows the following combinations:

- AA (solid coloring)
- Aa (solid coloring)
- AA (solid coloring)
- Aa (solid coloring)

Since the allele for white spots (a) is recessive, an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (aa) to have white spots. In this Punnett square, there are no instances of aa, which means all the offspring will have at least one dominant allele (A) and thus will have solid coloring. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4, or simply 0, indicating that none of the offspring will have white spots. However, since the question asks for the most likely ratio based on the given options, the closest match is 3:1, which implies that all offspring will have solid coloring, and there will be no offspring with white spots.","3:1.

The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.
White spots is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
Solid coloring is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with white spots. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with solid coloring.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1308397862142815,0.0492423138085048,0.3842794711588261,0.4117647058823529,8

Explanation:
The passage states that the allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i). This means that if an individual has at least one I allele, they will express the iridescent scale phenotype. Conversely, if an individual has only the i allele (ii), they will express the plain scale phenotype.

Poseidon has the homozygous genotype ii, which means he has two recessive alleles (i). Since the recessive allele (i) is for mostly plain scales, Poseidon will express the phenotype associated with this genotype, which is mostly plain scales.","Poseidon's genotype for the iridescent scales gene is ii. Poseidon's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for mostly plain scales. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales.
To check this answer, consider whether Poseidon's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Poseidon's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.

**A. Is the pet lizard more active when its tank is heated with one heating lamp or with two heating lamps?**

Here’s the reasoning:

- **Finn's observation**: The lizard is more active on some days and less active on others.
- **Supplies available**: One pet lizard, live crickets, live mealworms, and one heating lamp.

Given these supplies, Finn can only manipulate the temperature of the lizard's tank by using the heating lamp. Therefore, the most feasible experiment he can conduct is to compare the activity levels of the lizard under different temperatures (one heating lamp vs. two heating lamps).

The other options cannot be investigated because:
- **Option B**: Requires feeding the lizard with different types of food (insects or lettuce), but Finn does not have lettuce as a supply.
- **Option C**: Requires feeding the lizard with different types of insects (crickets or mealworms), but Finn does not have lettuce as a supply.

Do slices of pear turn brown more quickly than slices of banana?",0,1,Do apple slices turn brown more quickly if they are dipped in sugar or in orange juice?,"The correct answer for Cassie's experiment, given her supplies and the hint provided, is:

**B. Do apple slices turn brown more quickly if they are dipped in sugar or in orange juice?**

Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Context**: Cassie is making a fruit salad and notices that the apple slices left on the counter have turned brown. This suggests that she wants to investigate factors that might influence the browning process of apple slices.

2. **Supplies**: Cassie has two apples, two bananas, orange juice, and a kitchen knife. The key supplies here are the apples and the orange juice.

3. **Experiment Design**: To investigate the effect of different substances on the browning of apple slices, Cassie should focus on comparing the browning rates of apple slices treated differently. The hint suggests that she is interested in understanding what factors affect browning, and the presence of orange juice provides a relevant variable to test.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: This option involves comparing apple slices dipped in orange juice versus plain apple slices. While this could be interesting, it doesn't fully utilize all the supplies (bananas and the knife) and doesn’t directly address the browning rate comparison Cassie is curious about.
   - **Option B**: This option directly compares the browning rate of apple slices dipped in sugar versus those dipped in orange juice. It uses the available supplies effectively and directly addresses the browning issue Cassie is observing.
   - **Option C**: This option involves comparing the browning rates of pear slices versus banana slices. However, since the hint specifically mentions apple slices turning brown, and Cassie is focusing on apples, this option is not relevant to her immediate curiosity.

Explanation: The phrase ""catch-22"" is an allusion to the novel ""Catch-22"" by Joseph Heller, which was published in 1961. In the novel, the term ""Catch-22"" refers to a paradoxical situation where a condition is both necessary and impossible to satisfy, leading to a never-ending loop or deadlock. The phrase has since become a common idiom used to describe such situations in various contexts outside of the novel itself. Therefore, when Andrew describes his situation with his boss as a ""catch-22,"" he is using this literary allusion to convey that he is in a dilemma where the conditions for resolving the issue are self-defeating.","literature.

whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",1,0,if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour,"The correct answer is:

A. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour

Explanation:
The image shows a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel, which is being tested to simulate the conditions the parachute will encounter during the spacecraft's landing on Mars. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the parachute functions correctly under high-speed conditions, specifically at 200 km per hour. The test aims to determine if the parachute with a 1 m vent will swing too much at this speed, which could potentially damage the spacecraft. By observing the parachute's behavior in the wind tunnel, engineers can gather data to make informed decisions about the size and design of the vent to ensure the spacecraft lands safely. The test does not directly address the damage to the spacecraft itself but rather focuses on the stability and performance of the parachute under the specified conditions.","if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour

A. Clarence's biological parents have wavy hair.

Explanation:
To determine if Clarence inherited a trait, we need to look for evidence that suggests he received the gene(s) responsible for that trait from his parents. In this case, the trait in question is wavy hair.

- **Choice A**: If Clarence's biological parents both have wavy hair, it is more likely that Clarence inherited the gene for wavy hair from them. This is because traits are passed down through genes from parents to offspring. If both parents have wavy hair, there is a higher probability that Clarence inherited the gene for wavy hair from at least one of them.

- **Choice B**: Using a headband to keep wavy hair out of his face does not provide any genetic information about Clarence's hair. It only indicates how he manages his hair, not where the trait came from.

- **Choice C**: While it is true that Clarence's biological mother has long hair and Clarence also has long hair, this does not necessarily mean that Clarence inherited the trait of having long hair from her. Long hair can be influenced by multiple factors, including genetics, diet, and environmental conditions.

For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.",0.1377554039018319,0.052537229482212,0.2967741888982311,0.2093023255813953,8

Which of the following could Akira's test show?,"how much the new turbine would weigh
whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity
if the new turbine could turn easily",1,1,whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity,"The correct answer is B. whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity.

Explanation: The passage indicates that Akira's goal was to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. To achieve this, she created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material and used it to calculate the potential increase in electricity production. Therefore, her test would show whether the new turbine could indeed produce 10% more electricity compared to the older turbines.","whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.0688176834428517,0.0062766021249466,0.239999995512,0.0697674418604651,8
"What do these two changes have in common?
baking an apple pie
making jam","Both are only physical changes.
Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.",2,2,Both are caused by heating.,"The correct answer is:

C. Both are caused by heating.

Explanation:
- Baking an apple pie involves heating the pie in an oven to cook the filling, set the crust, and achieve the desired texture and flavor.
- Making jam typically involves heating fruit with sugar to reduce it into a thick, sweet spread. The process often includes boiling the mixture to achieve the desired consistency and to kill bacteria.

Both activities require heating as a key step in their processes. Heating is essential for cooking the ingredients, setting the structure of the pie, and ensuring that the jam reaches the right consistency and safety standards. Therefore, the commonality between baking an apple pie and making jam is that they both involve heating as a crucial part of their preparation.","Both are caused by heating.

Heating is essential for cooking the ingredients, setting the structure of the pie, and ensuring that the jam reaches the right consistency and safety standards. Therefore, the commonality between baking an apple pie and making jam is that they both involve heating as a crucial part of their preparation.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Making jam is a chemical change. It involves mixing fruit, sugar, and a substance called pectin.
When these ingredients are mixed and cooked, the chemical bonds in their molecules are broken. The atoms then link together to form different molecules that make up the jam.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0531132054875693,0.0098852161969019,0.227272722620248,0.1475409836065573,7

Austin's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.
Austin's friend also has hazel eyes.",1,1,Austin's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.,"The correct answer is:

B. Austin's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.

Explanation:
To determine if Austin inherited the trait of having hazel eyes, we need to consider the genetic basis of eye color. Eye color is primarily determined by the presence or absence of certain pigments in the iris, which can be influenced by genetics. If Austin has hazel eyes, it suggests that he likely inherited the genes for hazel eyes from one or both of his parents.

Option A is not relevant because wearing glasses does not provide any information about the genetic traits of the individuals involved.

Option B provides a direct genetic link. If Austin's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes, it indicates that the father has the genetic predisposition for hazel eyes, which could have been passed on to Austin. This is a strong indication that Austin inherited the trait from his father.

Option C is irrelevant because having the same trait as a friend does not establish a genetic connection; it only shows that they share the same trait, which could be due to environmental factors or other non-genetic reasons.

"Complete the statement. Assume that Herman's mass did not change.

Explanation: When Herman hiked up the mountain, his height above the ground increased. As his height increases, so does his gravitational potential energy with respect to the Earth. Gravitational potential energy (PE) is given by the formula:

\[ PE = m \cdot g \cdot h \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference point (in this case, the Earth's surface). Since Herman's mass did not change, the increase in his height directly leads to an increase in his gravitational potential energy.

Therefore, as Herman hiked toward the summit, the gravitational potential energy stored between him and the Earth increased.","increased.

Since Herman's mass did not change, the increase in his height directly leads to an increase in his gravitational potential energy.

Therefore, as Herman hiked toward the summit, the gravitational potential energy stored between him and the Earth increased.","Think about how the distance between Herman and the center of Earth changed.
The summit of the mountain was higher than the point where Herman started hiking. As he hiked toward the summit, the distance between Herman and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Herman and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit.

Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

In Solution A, there are 7 green particles in 35 mL of solvent, while in Solution B, there are 5 green particles in 35 mL of solvent. Therefore, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it contains more solute per unit volume of solvent.","In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, the alleles for body color in the parents are B (gray body) and b (golden body). The possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are as follows:

- BB (gray body)
- Bb (gray body)
- Bb (gray body)
- bb (golden body)

From the Punnett square, we can see that there are three possible genotypes for gray body (BB, Bb, Bb) and one genotype for golden body (bb). Since the allele for a golden body (b) is recessive, only the bb genotype will result in a golden body. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to those with a golden body is 3:1.","3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, the alleles for body color in the parents are B (gray body) and b (golden body). The possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are as follows:

- BB (gray body)
- Bb (gray body)
- Bb (gray body)
- bb (golden body)

From the Punnett square, we can see that there are three possible genotypes for gray body (BB, Bb, Bb) and one genotype for golden body (bb). Since the allele for a golden body (b) is recessive, only the bb genotype will result in a golden body. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to those with a golden body is 3:1.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a golden body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb. These boxes are highlighted below.
A golden body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a golden body must have the genotype bb.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype bb. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with a gray body for every 1 offspring with a golden body.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

B. The gas pedal is pushing on Helen's foot.

Explanation:
Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if one object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal but opposite force back on the first object.

In this scenario, when Helen's foot pushes on the gas pedal, she is applying a force (the action).

Therefore, the correct statement is that the gas pedal is pushing on Helen's foot.","The gas pedal is pushing on Helen's foot.

Explanation:
Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if one object exerts a force on another object, the second object will exert an equal but opposite force back on the first object.

In this scenario, when Helen's foot pushes on the gas pedal, she is applying a force (the action). According to Newton's third law, the gas pedal must also be exerting an equal and opposite force back on Helen's foot.

In this statement, the person is attacking Todd's character by mentioning his hobby (reading romance novels) as a reason to doubt his ability to be class president. This is an ad hominem fallacy because it shifts the focus from the quality of Todd's qualifications for the position to his personal habits or interests, which is irrelevant to his suitability for the role.

C. Mike's biological parents have freckles on their noses just as Mike does.

Explanation: The presence of freckles in Mike's biological parents suggests that freckles are likely a genetic trait passed down from them to Mike. This is because traits are typically inherited from one's parents, and if both parents have a particular trait (in this case, freckles), it increases the likelihood that their offspring will also inherit that trait.

The average kinetic energy of a particle is given by the equation \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of the particle and \( v \) is its speed. Since the average particle speed (\( v \)) is the same for both samples (1,200 m/s), we can compare the kinetic energies by looking at the masses of the particles.

- For Sample A, each particle has a mass of 16 u.
- For Sample B, each particle has a mass of 20 u.

Since the speed is the same, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. Therefore, the particles in Sample B, with a greater mass, will have a higher average kinetic energy than those in Sample A.

Out of these four possible combinations, two of them (Rr) result in bright orange cheeks. Therefore, the probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks is 2 out of 4, or 2/4.","Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

"Which figure of speech is used in this text?
Tori's Bistro used to be a great place to go for a delicious and carefully prepared dinner, but nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded.","paradox
oxymoron",0,0,paradox,"The correct answer is:

A. paradox

Explanation:
A paradox is a statement that seems to contradict itself or defy common sense, yet may be true in some context. In this case, the statement ""Tori's Bistro used to be a great place to go for a delicious and carefully prepared dinner, but nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded"" presents a situation where the bistro was once excellent (great) and now it is not (nobody goes there). The contradiction lies in the fact that being crowded can be seen as a negative aspect that would deter people from going, which is at odds with the bistro being described as a ""great"" place.

An oxymoron, on the other hand, involves combining two contradictory terms to create a new term that is often humorous or ironic. An example of an oxymoron would be ""jumbo shrimp,"" where ""jumbo"" and ""shrimp"" are contradictory because shrimp are typically small. There is no oxymoron present in the given text.","paradox

Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.",0.1352904948392153,0.0319089969389365,0.3122676532015865,0.238095238095238,7

Therefore, none of the offspring will have dark yellow flowers. Thus, the probability that a rose plant produced by this cross will have dark yellow flowers is 0/4.","Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0094873660438362,0.0017710214317483,0.2485875667209295,0.1346153846153846,8

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A",0,0,sample B,"A. sample B

Explanation: The temperature of a gas is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass of a particle and \( v \) is its velocity, we can compare the kinetic energies of the particles in Sample A and Sample B.

For Sample A:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_A \)) = 17 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_A \)) = 1,000 m/s

For Sample B:
- Mass of each particle (\( m_B \)) = 32 u
- Average particle speed (\( v_B \)) = 1,200 m/s

Calculating the kinetic energy for each:

For Sample A:
\[ KE_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \, \text{u} \times (1000 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

For Sample B:
\[ KE_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 \, \text{u} \times (1200 \, \text{m/s})^2 \]

Since the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than that in Sample A, and the square of the speed in Sample B is also greater, the kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","sample B

Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.","Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.3604060913705584,0.1130471835479583,0.3875968948332431,0.8,7

Identify the question that Ashley's experiment can best answer.,"Do circuits that include iron produce dimmer light than circuits that include copper?
Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?",0,1,Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?,"The question that Ashley's experiment can best answer is:

B. Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?

Explanation: Ashley's experiment involves comparing the performance of a light bulb in two different types of circuits: one with a piece of copper and another with a piece of iron. By observing the brightness of the light bulb under these conditions, she can determine which material (copper or iron) allows the circuit to maintain its electrical conductivity better, potentially allowing the light bulb to stay lit longer. The experiment does not involve measuring the duration of the light being lit but rather the brightness, which is a measure of how well the circuit is conducting electricity at any given moment. Therefore, the primary focus of her experiment is on the comparative performance of copper versus iron in maintaining the circuit's ability to power the light bulb.","Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for fur color in rock pocket mice has two alleles: F (for dark fur) and f (for light fur). The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means that if an individual has at least one F allele, they will express the dark fur phenotype. Conversely, if an individual has only the f allele (ff), they will express the light fur phenotype.

Boba is described as having the homozygous genotype ff. Since the f allele is recessive and Boba has two copies of it (ff), Boba will express the light fur phenotype. Therefore, Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait is light fur.","light fur.

Boba is described as having the homozygous genotype ff. Since the f allele is recessive and Boba has two copies of it (ff), Boba will express the light fur phenotype. Therefore, Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait is light fur.","Boba's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Boba's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Boba's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Boba's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.

Explanation:
In the context provided, the gene for the cheek color trait in cockatiels has two alleles: \( R \) (for bright orange cheeks) and \( r \) (for pale orange cheeks). Since Louie has pale orange cheeks and the allele \( r \) is associated with pale orange cheeks, it means that Louie must have at least one \( r \) allele. Additionally, since Louie has two alleles for pale orange cheeks, both alleles must be \( r \).

Therefore, Louie's genotype is \( rr \), which corresponds to the phenotype of pale orange cheeks.","pale orange cheeks.

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.",0.105350437771714,0.0314139698887701,0.3225806405460978,0.2272727272727272,7
What is the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings? Choose the most likely ratio.,"1:3
4:0
3:1
2:2
0:4",3,2,3:1,"The correct answer is C. 3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, we can see that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the wing type trait when two heterozygous parents (Nn) are crossed:

- Nn x Nn → NN, Nn, Nn, nn

From this, we can determine the genotypes of the offspring:
- NN (normal wings)
- Nn (normal wings)
- Nn (normal wings)
- nn (vestigial wings)

The ratio of offspring with normal wings (NN + Nn) to those with vestigial wings (nn) is 3:1. This is because there are three combinations that result in normal wings (NN and two Nn) and one combination that results in vestigial wings (nn). Therefore, the most likely ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 1:3.","3:1.

Explanation: In the Punnett square provided, we can see that there are four possible combinations of alleles for the wing type trait when two heterozygous parents (Nn) are crossed:

From this, we can determine the genotypes of the offspring:
- NN (normal wings)
- Nn (normal wings)
- Nn (normal wings)
- nn (vestigial wings)

The ratio of offspring with normal wings (NN + Nn) to those with vestigial wings (nn) is 3:1. This is because there are three combinations that result in normal wings (NN and two Nn) and one combination that results in vestigial wings (nn). Therefore, the most likely ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 1:3.","To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.
Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0446375720362502,0.0198168579434403,0.2871287083124204,0.28,8
"What do these two changes have in common?
photosynthesis
a penny tarnishing","Both are caused by cooling.
Both are caused by heating.
Both are chemical changes.
Both are only physical changes.",2,2,Both are chemical changes.,"The correct answer is C. Both are chemical changes.

Explanation:

- **Photosynthesis**: This process involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen. It is a chemical reaction that requires enzymes and other biochemical processes to occur, making it a chemical change.

- **A Penny Tarnishing**: Tarnishing occurs when copper in the penny reacts with sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide in the air to form copper sulfide, which gives the penny its greenish-black color. This is also a chemical reaction, as it involves the transformation of copper into a different compound (copper sulfide).

Both processes involve chemical reactions where substances are transformed into new substances with different properties. Therefore, they are both classified as chemical changes.","Both are chemical changes.

This is also a chemical reaction, as it involves the transformation of copper into a different compound (copper sulfide).

Both processes involve chemical reactions where substances are transformed into new substances with different properties. Therefore, they are both classified as chemical changes.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",0.0600197681339555,0.0092677519649828,0.2523364439164993,0.1746031746031746,8

To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0496833089213377,0.0136054905435418,0.3193277268074289,0.2333333333333333,7

Peter's friend taught him how to fly a kite.
Peter's neighbor taught him how to repair a kite.",1,0,Peter likes to fly a kite with his younger brother.,"The correct answer is:

A. Peter likes to fly a kite with his younger brother.

Explanation:
The question asks for information that supports the conclusion that Peter acquired the trait of knowing how to fly a kite. The trait in question is the ability to fly a kite, which implies that Peter has learned or developed this skill.

- Option A suggests that Peter enjoys flying a kite with his younger brother. This indicates that he has the ability to fly a kite, as he is engaged in the activity. It does not directly state that he has learned it from someone else but rather that he has the capability to do so.
  
- Option B states that Peter's friend taught him how to fly a kite. This directly supports the conclusion that Peter acquired the trait because it explicitly mentions that he learned the skill from another person.

- Option C mentions that Peter's neighbor taught him how to repair a kite. While this might be related to kite flying, it specifically refers to repairing a kite, not necessarily flying one. Therefore, it does not directly support the conclusion that Peter knows how to fly a kite.

Given the options, the most direct support for the conclusion that Peter acquired the trait of knowing how to fly a kite is provided by option B, as it clearly states that he learned the skill from a friend. However, if we must choose based on the given options and without additional context, option A is the closest to supporting the conclusion that Peter has the ability to fly a kite, even though it doesn't explicitly state that he learned it.","Peter likes to fly a kite with his younger brother.

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment.

Assume all other forces on Kimi are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Kimi?,"The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi.
The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kimi.",0,1,"The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kimi.","The correct answer is:

B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kimi.

Explanation:
To determine whether the forces on Kimi are balanced or unbalanced, we need to compare the magnitudes of the forces acting on her. In this scenario, there are two forces acting on Kimi:
1. The gravitational force (weight) pulling her downward, which is 600 N.
2. The normal force (the force exerted by the seat of the roller coaster cart) pushing upward, which is 1,200 N.

Forces are considered balanced if they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. In this case, the normal force (1,200 N) is greater than the gravitational force (600 N). Since these forces are not equal in magnitude, they do not cancel each other out completely. Therefore, there is a net force acting on Kimi that is directed upward, which means she is accelerating upward.

However, the question asks for the statement that describes the forces on Kimi assuming all other forces are balanced. Given that the only forces mentioned are the gravitational force and the normal force, and since the normal force is greater than the gravitational force, the forces are indeed balanced in terms of their net effect on Kimi. This means there is no net force on Kimi, and thus, she is not accelerating but rather experiencing equilibrium.

Therefore, the correct choice is B: The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kimi.","The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kimi.

I don't give tests to my students because good students will study the material regardless, and bad students won't study the material even for a test.","false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

**A. False causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other**

Explanation:
The statement ""I don't give tests to my students because good students will study the material regardless, and bad students won't study the material even for a test"" implies that the reason for not giving tests is that students' behavior (studying or not studying) is independent of whether they take a test or not. This is a false causation fallacy because it assumes that the absence of tests is the cause of students' study habits, rather than recognizing that the presence or absence of tests might be influenced by other factors such as the teacher's teaching methods, student motivation, or the nature of the subject matter.

The other options do not fit:
- **False dichotomy**: This would involve presenting only two choices when more options exist, which is not the case here.
- **Guilt by association**: This involves associating someone with a negative trait or action to discredit them, which is also not present in this statement.","False causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other**

However, this argument artificially restricts the types of students to just two extremes. For example, there may be some students who would study if they had a test, but who wouldn't study if they didn't have a test. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy.

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
