Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Gordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2515,0.1075,0.2527,0.4725

Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep: The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets. In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0.","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.
A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1007,0.0439,0.2059,0.3925

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is C Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.3173,0.1552,0.3556,0.4627

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive

The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e). This Punnett square shows a cross between two American curl cats.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that an American curl cat produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the ear type gene is 1/4.","The right answare is C Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0476,0.0065,0.1272,0.2857

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.  A rat tapeworm is a type of flatworm that can live inside a rat's body. When a rat eats an insect that has a tapeworm inside it, the insect is digested, but the tapeworm remains alive. The tapeworm is moved into the rat's intestines and uses suckers to attach itself to the intestine wall. Inside the rat's intestine, the tapeworm absorbs nutrients from food that the rat has eaten. If the rat has many tapeworms in its intestines, it will become weak from lack of nutrients. Figure: a tapeworm attached to the wall of an intestine.

Answer:","The right answare is A When a rat tapeworm attaches itself to a rat's intestine, the tapeworm gets nutrients that it needs to grow and survive. So, the tapeworm benefits from its relationship with the rat.
The rat loses nutrients from its food to the tapeworm. So, the rat is harmed by its relationship with the tapeworm.
Since the tapeworm benefits and the rat is harmed, a parasitic relationship is formed when a rat tapeworm attaches itself to the intestine of a rat.

Hint: Marble has the following properties: naturally occurring no fixed crystal structure solid dissolves in acid not made by organisms made mostly of calcite

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Marble is a mineral.","The right answare is A The properties of marble match the properties of a rock. So, marble is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0012,0.0001,0.1313,0.21

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

It is a","The right answare is B The properties of dolerite match the properties of a rock. So, dolerite is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0935,0.0086,0.247,0.2475

Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the space-filling model shown above, all of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that light green represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol Be. So, the model shows you that beryllium is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that beryllium is composed of only one chemical element. So, beryllium is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.

Answer:","bout our solar system true or false? Of the four smallest planets, two are made mainly of gas.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A To decide which four planets are the smallest, look at the volumes and compare the exponents. The volumes of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars have the smallest exponents. So, these four planets are the smallest.
These four planets are made mainly of rock. So, of the four smallest planets, none are made mainly of gas.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15",0.0075,0.0032,0.1129,0.2073

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 1:3.","normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body? Choose the most likely ratio.
A. 1:3
B. 4:0
C. 0:4
D. 2:2
E. 3:1

Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 1:3.","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0262,0.0136,0.194,0.3303

Answer: The black bear is the omnivore in this food web.","The right answare is D Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The black bear has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree, which is a producer. The black bear also has arrows pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver, which are consumers. The black bear eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.
The gray fox has two arrows pointing to it. These arrows start from the swallowtail caterpillar and the pine vole, which are both consumers.  So, the gray fox is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The pine vole has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree, which is a producer. The pine vole also has an arrow pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar, which is a consumer. The pine vole eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not an omnivore.
The black racer has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the pine vole, which is a consumer. So, the black racer is a consumer but not an omnivore.

Answer:","bout our solar system true or false? Three-quarters of the planets are larger than Earth.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A To decide which planets are larger than Earth, look at the volumes of the other planets and compare the exponents to the exponent of Earth's volume. Earth's volume is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3. Earth's volume is the only volume with an exponent of 12.
The volumes of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have exponents greater than 12, so these four planets are larger than Earth. There are eight planets total. So, one-half of the planets are larger than Earth.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15",0.0023,0.0012,0.0794,0.1538

It is a rock","The right answare is A The properties of scoria match the properties of a rock. So, scoria is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0984,0.0089,0.2373,0.24

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a Syrian hamster produced by this cross will have long fur is 2/4.","The right answare is A Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0242,0.0017,0.1268,0.2685

Then, she added worms to two of the containers but not to the other two. After one month, Susan weighed the amount of undecomposed food left in each container. Figure: food decomposing in a compost bin.","The right answare is A In this experiment, Susan investigated whether adding worms to compost containers affects how well food breaks down. There were no worms in the containers that did not get worms. So, they were part of a control group.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.2691,0.0475,0.1624,0.3011

The volume of Mars is more than ten times as large as Mercury's.
A. true
B. false

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","bout our solar system true or false? The volume of Mars is more than ten times as large as Mercury's.
A. true
B. false

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3, which is less than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Mars is less than ten times as large as Mercury's.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.003,0.0016,0.1206,0.2316

Conglomerate forms when layers of sand, mud, and pebbles are pressed together to form rock.","The right answare is A Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Material that is eroded in nature is called sediment. Sand, mud, and pebbles are all types of sediment. Over time, layers of these sediments can build up in places like riverbeds. The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Conglomerate forms when the bottom layers of sediment are pressed together to form rock.

Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.",0.3035,0.0753,0.2623,0.3068

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

Python reticulatus has the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Sciurus vulgaris does not have the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, Python reticulatus and Sciurus vulgaris are not in the same species.
Python reticulatus is in the same genus as Python bivittatus, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Python reticulatus and Python bivittatus are different species within the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1097,0.0236,0.1694,0.2785

Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.","The right answare is A Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.2875,0.0913,0.262,0.4865

Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California. A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The decomposer in this food web is the sea otter.","The right answare is D Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The bat star does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the bat star is a decomposer.
The sea otter has an arrow pointing from it. So, the sea otter is not a decomposer.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing from it. So, the kelp bass is not a decomposer.
The sea cucumber does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the sea cucumber is a decomposer.
The black rockfish has an arrow pointing from it. So, the black rockfish is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.0304,0.0053,0.1907,0.3061

Answer: The insect is older than the leaf.","nswer.
A. ginkgo leaf
B. insect

Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The insect is older than the leaf.","The right answare is A Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The ginkgo leaf fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the insect fossil. So, the ginkgo leaf fossil is most likely older than the insect fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0042,0.0006,0.1402,0.1905

The gaps come from air and water bubbles that became trapped while the melted rock was cooling.","The right answare is A Scoria is an igneous rock. Like other igneous rocks, it forms when melted rock cools and hardens.
Melted rock at the earth's surface is called lava. Scoria forms from a type of lava that is rich in iron and magnesium. As the lava erupts from a volcano, it can trap small bubbles of air or water. When the lava becomes solid, the bubbles leave behind gaps in the rock.

Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.",0.2578,0.0575,0.2455,0.3

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each purple ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0609,0.0282,0.208,0.2222

A. echinoderm
B. cnidarian

Hint: Read the text. Invertebrates make up the majority of Earth's living things, but there are many different groups, or phyla, of invertebrates. Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means ""nettle,"" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean. Another phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning ""spiny"" and ""skin."" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins.

Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.","The right answare is A The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.2399,0.0538,0.2594,0.4634

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.2992,0.1508,0.3438,0.3519

Hint: In a group of rabbits, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rabbits.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 1:3.","The right answare is D To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.
Black fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with black fur for every 1 offspring with brown fur.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0198,0.0092,0.1697,0.3365

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The owl is a great gray owl.","The right answare is C A great gray owl's scientific name is Strix nebulosa. The first word of its scientific name is Strix.
Cyanea capillata is in the genus Cyanea. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanea. So, Cyanea capillata and Strix nebulosa are not in the same genus.
Neofelis nebulosa and Strix nebulosa are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Neofelis nebulosa and Strix nebulosa have the same species name within their genus, nebulosa. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Neofelis nebulosa is in the genus Neofelis, and Strix nebulosa is in the genus Strix.
Strix varia is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix varia and Strix nebulosa are in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.2552,0.0453,0.1794,0.3118

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.3005,0.0057,0.1865,0.2892

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury",0.0001,0.0,0.0677,0.0968

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.2183,0.0405,0.1517,0.2717

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.292,0.0122,0.2267,0.2976

Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The fossil is the egg of a crocodile.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The palm leaf fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the crocodile egg fossil. So, the palm leaf fossil is most likely older than the crocodile egg fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0059,0.0008,0.1376,0.2093

The allele for sweet fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for sour fruit (F). This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a muskmelon plant produced by this cross will be homozygous recessive for the fruit taste gene is 2/4.","The right answare is C Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0441,0.0067,0.133,0.2959

Answer:","The right answare is C Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.",0.2992,0.1508,0.3359,0.3636

Answer: The orca is the primary consumer in this food web.","The right answare is C Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The black rockfish has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton. The zooplankton is not a producer. So, the black rockfish is not a primary consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is not a primary consumer.
The orca has an arrow pointing to it from the sea otter. The sea otter is not a producer. So, the orca is not a primary consumer.
The sea urchin has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is a producer, so the sea urchin is a primary consumer.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is a producer, so the kelp bass is a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles because it has more solute particles.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0547,0.0223,0.2097,0.2361

Answer: The smallest planet is made mainly of rock.","The right answare is B To decide which planet is the smallest, look at the volumes shown in the table and compare the exponents. Mercury's volume has an exponent of 10, which is the smallest out of all the planets.
Mercury is made mainly of rock. So, the smallest planet is made mainly of rock.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:

Answer: The Christmas tree worm is a spirobranchus. It is a type of sea anemone.","The right answare is B A Christmas tree worm's scientific name is Spirobranchus giganteus.
Sphodromantis viridis does not have the same scientific name as a Christmas tree worm. So, Spirobranchus giganteus and Sphodromantis viridis are not in the same species.
Macropus giganteus does have the same species within its genus as a Christmas tree worm, but they are not in the same genus! They do not have the same scientific name as each other. So, these organisms are not in the same species.
Spirobranchus giganteus has the same scientific name as a Christmas tree worm. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0911,0.008,0.2315,0.2574

The independent","The right answare is A Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.2828,0.0442,0.2097,0.3778

Answer:","omplete the statement. Silicon carbide is ().
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Hint: The model below represents silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is a hard substance used in car brakes and in bulletproof vests.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether silicon carbide is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that silicon carbide is composed of carbon atoms and silicon atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that silicon carbide is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and silicon. Since silicon carbide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silicon carbide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents the compound pyrite.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.",0.0006,0.0001,0.1233,0.1333

Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

The food web is a diagram of how the matter in an ecosystem moves through the ecosystem. The arrows represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.","The right answare is B Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the earthworm.
No arrows point from the mushroom to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the mushroom to the earthworm.There are three paths matter can take from the bear sedge to the earthworm: bear sedge->brown lemming->Arctic fox->earthworm. bear sedge->brown lemming->snowy owl->earthworm. bear sedge->brown lemming->parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk->earthworm. There are four paths matter can take from the bilberry to the earthworm: bilberry->Arctic fox->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->Arctic fox->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->snowy owl->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk->earthworm. There is one path matter can take from the short-tailed weasel to the earthworm: short-tailed weasel->snowy owl->earthworm. There is one path matter can take from the snowy owl to the earthworm: snowy owl->earthworm.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 3:1.","The right answare is C To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.
Yellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.
Green pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0158,0.0074,0.1642,0.3393

Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The fossil is the egg of a crocodile.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The fern fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the crocodile egg fossil. So, the fern fossil is most likely older than the crocodile egg fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0052,0.0007,0.1302,0.2

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.2167,0.1093,0.3344,0.411

Answer: The agile wallaby is a marsupial that lives in Australia. It is a member of the kangaroo family.","The right answare is A An agile wallaby's scientific name is Macropus agilis. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus.
Hyla cinerea is in the genus Hyla. The first word of its scientific name is Hyla. So, Hyla cinerea and Macropus agilis are not in the same genus.
Lacerta agilis and Macropus agilis are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Lacerta agilis and Macropus agilis have the same species name within their genus, agilis. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Lacerta agilis is in the genus Lacerta, and Macropus agilis is in the genus Macropus.
This organism and the agile wallaby are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Macropus agilis.

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has more solute particles.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0547,0.0186,0.2097,0.2361

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.2756,0.0891,0.2338,0.2921

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Ernest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2515,0.1075,0.2491,0.4725

Answer: Ethane is an elementary substance.","omplete the statement. Ethane is ().
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of ethane. Ethane is used to make plastic bags.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Ethane is an elementary substance.","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether ethane is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of ethane is composed of six hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that ethane is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and carbon. Since ethane is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, ethane is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Earth's volume is more than ten times as great as Mars's volume.","The right answare is A To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^12 km^3. So, Earth's volume is less than ten times as great as Mars's volume.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0116,0.0047,0.1398,0.2151

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury",0.0352,0.0006,0.1805,0.1604

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Answer: The American alligator is a large reptile that lives in the United States. It is a member of the family Alligatoridae.","The right answare is B An American alligator's scientific name is Alligator mississippiensis.
Aequorea victoria does not have the same scientific name as an American alligator. So, Alligator mississippiensis and Aequorea victoria are not in the same species.
Alligator mississippiensis is in the same genus as Alligator sinensis, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Alligator mississippiensis and Alligator sinensis are different species within the same genus.
Alligator mississippiensis has the same scientific name as an American alligator. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of ethanol. Ethanol can be used as a fuel. Most of the gasoline that is used in the United States is about 10% ethanol.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Ethanol is an elementary substance.","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether ethanol is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of ethanol is composed of six hydrogen atoms, two carbon atoms, and one oxygen atom bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that ethanol is composed of three chemical elements: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Since ethanol is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, ethanol is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.2838,0.0873,0.2797,0.4141

The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Mitchell, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Mitchell thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use. So, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed. Figure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3308,0.1345,0.2574,0.4615

Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

Answer: The fern spore grows into a fern.","The right answare is B After they are released, spores can land on the ground and germinate. When a spore germinates, it grows into a heart-shaped plant.
Mature fern plants grow from fertilized eggs.

Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.

There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada. A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The brown lemming is the first organism in the food web. It eats the bilberry, which is the second organism in the food web. The bilberry then eats the brown lemming, which is the third organism in the food web. The brown lemming then eats the bilberry, which is the fourth organism in the food web.

The brown lemming then eats","The right answare is B Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the mushroom.There is one path matter can take from the bilberry to the mushroom: bilberry->grizzly bear->mushroom. There is one path matter can take from the grizzly bear to the mushroom: grizzly bear->mushroom. There are two paths matter can take from the barren-ground caribou to the mushroom: barren-ground caribou->mushroom. barren-ground caribou->grizzly bear->mushroom. There are two paths matter can take from the lichen to the mushroom: lichen->barren-ground caribou->mushroom. lichen->barren-ground caribou->grizzly bear->mushroom. brown lemming. There are three arrows pointing from the brown lemming to other organisms. One arrow points to the Arctic fox. The only arrow pointing from the Arctic fox leads to the earthworm. The second arrow pointing from the brown lemming leads to the short-tailed weasel. The only arrow pointing from the short-tailed weasel leads to the snowy owl. The only arrow pointing from the snowy owl leads to the earthworm. The third arrow pointing from the brown lemming leads to the parasitic jaeger. The only arrow pointing from the parasitic jaeger leads to the rough-legged hawk. The only arrow pointing from the rough-legged hawk leads to the earthworm. No arrows point from the earthworm to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the brown lemming to the mushroom..

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.0998,0.0219,0.1962,0.2735

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

232,Which term matches the picture?,operant conditioning | classical conditioning,,A,A,"Question:Question: Which term matches the picture?
A. operant conditioning
B. classical conditioning

Hint: Read the text. A conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning. Operant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury",0.1402,0.0029,0.1969,0.1759

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson

use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive

Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the space-filling model shown above, all of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that dark blue represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol Ni. So, the model shows you that nickel is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that nickel is composed of only one chemical element. So, nickel is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.

B. false

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.","The right answare is B To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0199,0.0094,0.1672,0.2556

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.3077,0.1468,0.3358,0.4394

A. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards
B. if the blade guards would break in a crash
C. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Hayley was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Hayley wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Hayley put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2943,0.1284,0.2788,0.4176

Ulex europaeus and Caprimulgus europaeus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ulex europaeus and Caprimulgus europaeus have the same species name within their genus, europaeus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ulex europaeus is in the genus Ulex, and Caprimulgus europaeus is in the genus Caprimulgus.
Acanthaster planci is in the genus Acanthaster. The first word of its scientific name is Acanthaster. So, Acanthaster planci and Caprimulgus europaeus are not in the same genus.
Caprimulgus macrurus is in the genus Caprimulgus. The first word of its scientific name is Caprimulgus. So, Caprimulgus macrurus and Caprimulgus europaeus are in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0831,0.0145,0.1679,0.2911

A. A flavorant might be both found in nature and made in a chemical factory.
B. A substance's chemical structure depends only on the number and types of atoms in each molecule of the substance.

Hint: A substance's physical and chemical properties are all determined by its chemical structure. Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged. One property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor. Syrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones. Substances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both. One example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory.

Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 3:1.","The right answare is E To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have horns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have horns.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0168,0.0083,0.1673,0.3303

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Neptune.
Then compare the result to the volume of Uranus. The volume of Uranus is 6.83 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 6.25 x 10^14 km^3. So, the volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0031,0.002,0.1214,0.2105

The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This Punnett square shows a cross between two horses.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat is 1:3.","The right answare is E To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.
A reddish-brown coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a reddish-brown coat must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
A black coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the dominant version of the coat color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with a reddish-brown coat for every 2 offspring with a black coat.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

Hint: In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 4:0.","The right answare is D To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.
Sweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Sour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with sweet fruit to offspring with sour fruit is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with sweet fruit for every 2 offspring with sour fruit.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0153,0.0071,0.1596,0.3429

Answer: Neptune's volume is more than 100 times as large as Earth's","bout our solar system true or false? Neptune's volume is more than 100 times as large as Earth's.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Neptune's volume is more than 100 times as large as Earth's","The right answare is A To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 100 times the volume of Earth.
Then compare the result to the volume of Neptune. The volume of Neptune is 6.25 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 1.08 x 10^14 km^3. So, Neptune's volume is less than 100 times as large as Earth's.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0101,0.0037,0.135,0.2128

Answer: The red-billed gull is a seagull. It is a member of the gull family, Larus grypus.","The right answare is C A red-billed gull's scientific name is Chroicocephalus scopulinus.
Chroicocephalus scopulinus has the same scientific name as a red-billed gull. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Haliaeetus leucocephalus does not have the same scientific name as a red-billed gull. So, Chroicocephalus scopulinus and Haliaeetus leucocephalus are not in the same species.
Chroicocephalus scopulinus is in the same genus as Chroicocephalus ridibundus, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Chroicocephalus scopulinus and Chroicocephalus ridibundus are different species within the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have red fruit and others have yellow fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit color trait has two alleles. The allele for red fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for yellow fruit (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:1.","The right answare is D To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.
Yellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
Red fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with yellow fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red fruit.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.016,0.0075,0.1682,0.3486

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B The temperature of each refrigerator increased, which means that the thermal energy of each refrigerator increased. So, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each refrigerator.

A change in an object's temperature indicates a change in the object's thermal energy:
An increase in temperature shows that the object's thermal energy increased. So, thermal energy was transferred into the object from its surroundings.

The volume of Saturn is more than ten times the volume of Uranus.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","bout our solar system true or false? The volume of Saturn is more than ten times the volume of Uranus.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Uranus.
Then compare the result to the volume of Saturn. The volume of Saturn is 8.27 x 10^14 km^3, which is greater than 6.83 x 10^14 km^3. So, the volume of Saturn is more than ten times the volume of Uranus.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0031,0.002,0.1214,0.2062

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0591,0.028,0.216,0.2222

A. commensal
B. parasitic
C. mutualistic

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.  Alpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows. A shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger. Both animals then retreat to the safety of the burrow.

Both animals then retreat to","The right answare is C When an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby, the goby alerts the shrimp about nearby predators. These alerts help the shrimp survive. So, the shrimp benefits from its relationship with the goby.
The goby also receives protection from predators when it shares the shrimp's burrow. So, the goby also benefits from its relationship with the shrimp.
Since both the shrimp and the goby benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby.

When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

The unpruned tomato plants were not pruned. So, they were not part of an experimental group.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.2639,0.0296,0.1687,0.3295

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Hematite is a mineral. It is a rock. It is a metal. It is a metal with a metallic luster. It is a mineral with a fixed crystal structure. It is a solid. It is a pure substance.","The right answare is B Hematite has all the properties of a mineral. So, hematite is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0317,0.0097,0.1918,0.23

Hint: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies: Most fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs. In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a). This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.

The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a). This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 1:3.","The right answare is C To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mutated antennae or normal antennae, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for mutated antennae, is dominant over the a allele, which is for normal antennae.
Mutated antennae is the dominant allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the antenna type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with mutated antennae must have the genotype AA or Aa.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal antennae is the recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the antenna type trait must have only recessive alleles for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with normal antennae must have the genotype aa.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with mutated antennae for every 1 offspring with normal antennae.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1101,0.0404,0.1993,0.4393

Hint: The model below represents potassium bromide. In some countries, potassium bromide can be used as medicine to treat seizures.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Potassium bromide is an elementary substance.","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether potassium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that potassium bromide is composed of potassium atoms and bromine atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that potassium bromide is composed of two chemical elements: potassium and bromine. Since potassium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium bromide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound potassium chloride.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0889,0.0082,0.237,0.24

Answer:","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with normal ears.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0674,0.0184,0.1828,0.3874

Answer: Granite is a mineral.","The right answare is B The properties of granite match the properties of a rock. So, granite is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

Answer: The probability that a fruit fly produced by this cross will have normal wings is 1/4.","The right answare is E Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0909,0.0046,0.129,0.3394

Figure: installing solar panels on a roof.","The right answare is A People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3008,0.1406,0.2505,0.3889

The allele for green body feathers (B) is dominant over the allele for blue body feathers (b). This Punnett square shows a cross between two budgerigar parakeets.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0229,0.0009,0.1014,0.2551

Answer:","The right answare is B To decide which planet is the smallest, look at the volumes shown in the table and compare the exponents. Mercury's volume has an exponent of 10, which is the smallest out of all the planets.
Mercury is made mainly of rock. So, the smallest planet is made mainly of rock.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12

It is also very smart and can learn very quickly.","The right answare is A A sand cat's scientific name is Felis margarita. The first word of its scientific name is Felis.
Lynx canadensis is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx canadensis and Felis margarita are not in the same genus.
Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx rufus and Felis margarita are not in the same genus.
This organism and the sand cat are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Felis margarita.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1313,0.0227,0.1751,0.2987

Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of phosphine. Phosphine is a poisonous gas that some farmers use to kill insects.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Phosphine is a poisonous gas that some farmers use to kill insects.","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether phosphine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of phosphine is composed of three hydrogen atoms and one phosphorus atom bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that phosphine is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and phosphorus. Since phosphine is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphine is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This Punnett square shows a cross between two cockatiels.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks is 2/4.","The right answare is B Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0255,0.0018,0.1263,0.2661

Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.2953,0.0124,0.2322,0.3012

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the island of Hispaniola. It is home to the earliest European settlements in the Americas. Christopher Columbus founded the first European settlement on the island in 1492 during his first voyage across the Atlantic.
Though many people lived on the island before Columbus's arrival, European countries quickly began to colonize the island. Eventually France and Spain both established colonies. The Spanish colony eventually became the country of the Dominican Republic, and the French colony eventually became the country of Haiti.

To find this out, read the passage carefully.
The Cascade Range is a volcanic arc in the Pacific Northwest that begins in California and runs north into British Columbia. As the North American Plate and the Juan de Fuca Plate move toward each other, oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts, or sinks, below continental crust of the North American Plate.
There are eighteen volcanoes in the Cascade Range, and some of them are still active. Mount St. Helens is an active volcano near Seattle, Washington. It last erupted in May of 1980.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Cascade Range formed as the two plates moved toward each other. So, the Cascade Range formed at a convergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
ocean-continent subduction zone
One type of convergent boundary is an ocean-continent subduction zone, which forms when a plate with oceanic crust and a plate with continental crust move toward each other. The oceanic crust subducts, or sinks, below the continental crust.
As the oceanic crust subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes called a volcanic arc.",0.4014,0.298,0.4922,0.5263

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The lynx is a large cat that lives in the northern parts of North America.","The right answare is C A Canada lynx's scientific name is Lynx canadensis.
Macropus agilis does not have the same scientific name as a Canada lynx. So, Lynx canadensis and Macropus agilis are not in the same species.
Lynx canadensis is in the same genus as Lynx rufus, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Lynx canadensis and Lynx rufus are different species within the same genus.
Lynx canadensis has the same scientific name as a Canada lynx. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Answer:","bout our solar system true or false? The volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury.
A. true
B. false

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is greater than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0529,0.0189,0.24,0.2632

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.2167,0.1093,0.3148,0.411

Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The fossil is the palm leaf.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The palm leaf fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the fern fossil. So, the palm leaf fossil is most likely younger than the fern fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0034,0.0005,0.1221,0.1882

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a cow produced by this cross will have solid coloring is 4/4.","The right answare is B Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.022,0.0015,0.1365,0.2752

Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e). This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 2:2.","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with black eyes. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with red eyes.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0222,0.01,0.1731,0.354

These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Macropus rufus and Lynx rufus have the same species name within their genus, rufus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Macropus rufus is in the genus Macropus, and Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx.
Python molurus is in the genus Python. The first word of its scientific name is Python. So, Python molurus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait. In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles.

The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G). This Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.
A yellow ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.
A white ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype gg.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a white ground spot.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0796,0.0348,0.2151,0.3818

Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.015,0.001,0.1174,0.2569

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of hydrazine. Hydrazine is used in some types of rocket fuels.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Hydrazine is an elementary substance.","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether hydrazine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of hydrazine is composed of four hydrogen atoms and two nitrogen atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that hydrazine is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and nitrogen. Since hydrazine is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, hydrazine is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a chicken produced by this cross will be heterozygous for the leg color gene is 2/4.","The right answare is A Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

Answer: The Western Alps formed at a boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate. The Eurasian Plate is a large plate that is moving toward the African Plate. The African Plate is a smaller plate that is moving away from the Eurasian Plate. The Eurasian Plate and the African Plate are colliding, and the Western Alps are formed.","The right answare is B To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Western Alps, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
Millions of years ago, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate began to move toward each other, eventually colliding. This plate motion formed many mountain ranges, including the Western Alps. The Western Alps run through European countries, including France, Italy, and Switzerland.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Western Alps formed as the two plates collided, or ran into each other. For two plates to collide, they must be moving toward each other. So, the Western Alps formed at a convergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
One type of convergent boundary is a continent-continent collision. This type of boundary forms when two plates with continental crust move toward each other. The collision compresses and folds the continental crust, forcing it upward to form a mountain range.",0.3208,0.1974,0.4196,0.4455

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

A. a mature fern
B. a heart-shaped plant

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A fern can produce spores.","The right answare is A A mature fern can make spores. Spores grow inside the spore case. When the spore case breaks open, the spores are released.
A heart-shaped plant produces eggs and sperm, not spores.

Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.",0.0043,0.0002,0.1453,0.1591

Answer: The primary consumer in this food web is the sea otter.","The right answare is C Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is not a primary consumer.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton is a producer, so the plainfin midshipman is a primary consumer.
The sea otter has an arrow pointing to it from the sea urchin. The sea urchin is not a producer. So, the sea otter is not a primary consumer.
The kelp does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the kelp is not a primary consumer.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is a producer, so the kelp bass is a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.0303,0.0053,0.1791,0.3218

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Hint: In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for white flowers (f) is recessive to the allele for red flowers (F). This Punnett square shows a cross between two scarlet rosemallow plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a scarlet rosemallow plant produced by this cross will have white flowers is 4/4.","The right answare is E Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Kenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2515,0.1075,0.2527,0.4725

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0052,0.0007,0.1395,0.2

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.2167,0.1048,0.3279,0.411

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a Labrador retriever produced by this cross will have brown fur is 4/4.","The right answare is C Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0242,0.0017,0.1268,0.2752

The underlined part of the passage explains that the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed as the two plates moved away from each other, or diverged. So, the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed at a divergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.",0.2451,0.2189,0.5089,0.5132

The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.3077,0.1534,0.3433,0.4394

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

Python reticulatus has the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Nerodia cyclopion does not have the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, Python reticulatus and Nerodia cyclopion are not in the same species.
Morelia viridis does not have the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, Python reticulatus and Morelia viridis are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0106,0.003,0.1571,0.2278

A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of oxygen. Billions of pounds of oxygen are produced in factories each year. ver half of this oxygen is used to help produce steel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Oxygen is an elementary substance.","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether oxygen is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the ball-and-stick model shown above, both of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that red represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol O. So, the model shows you that a molecule of oxygen is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that oxygen is composed of only one chemical element. So, oxygen is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.","The right answare is B Sperm are male cells. Cells that become sperm are found inside the pollen.
Eggs are female cells. The eggs are produced and stored in the ovary.

Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.",0.0092,0.0008,0.1236,0.1789

Answer: The probability that a Syrian hamster produced by this cross will have wavy fur is 1/4.","The right answare is E Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

Answer:","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

The first word of its scientific name is Python.
This organism and the Burmese python are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Python bivittatus.
Lithobates palustris is in the genus Lithobates. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates. So, Lithobates palustris and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.
Melanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Melanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus have the same species name within their genus, bivittatus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Melanoplus bivittatus is in the genus Melanoplus, and Python bivittatus is in the genus Python.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1029,0.0173,0.1916,0.2405

Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants: Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs. In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.

These plants form low bushes or shrubs. In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.072,0.02,0.176,0.3619

Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Moss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.
The sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.
The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.
When the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again.",0.0164,0.0016,0.1654,0.2697

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.2167,0.1048,0.3279,0.4189

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a pine tree.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The cones of a pine tree are fertilized by the pollen of other trees.","The right answare is B Fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside a fertilized cone.
Pollen grows inside male cones, not fertilized cones.

Gymnosperms are plants that have seeds but not flowers. Conifers are a type of a gymnosperm. Instead of flowers, conifers have cones. Conifers use their cones for sexual reproduction.
Most conifer trees have both male and female cones. The male cones produce pollen. The female cones produce eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the cone.
Male cones release pollen into the wind. Pollination happens when pollen lands on and sticks to the female cones. Self-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on the same tree. Cross-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on a different tree.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs at the base of the female cone's scales. This is called fertilization.
The fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures. They can be carried long distances by the wind. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow cones and begin the conifer life cycle again.",0.006,0.0003,0.128,0.172

Answer: The bird is older than the palm leaf.","The right answare is A Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The wood fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the palm leaf fossil. So, the wood fossil is most likely older than the palm leaf fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0049,0.0014,0.1395,0.1905

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.1031,0.0093,0.233,0.24

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Magnesium is an elementary substance.","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether magnesium is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the space-filling model shown above, all of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that green represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol Mg. So, the model shows you that magnesium is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that magnesium is composed of only one chemical element. So, magnesium is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance zirconium.

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The ferns life cycle is shown in the diagram.","The right answare is B Unlike sperm and eggs, spores do not fuse.
After they are released, spores can land on the ground and germinate. When a spore germinates, it grows into a heart-shaped plant.

Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.",0.0309,0.0051,0.1833,0.2889

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a sheep produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the wool color gene is 2/4.","The right answare is C Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0396,0.0061,0.1298,0.2755

Answer: The smallest planet is made mainly of rock.","The right answare is A To decide which planet is the smallest, look at the volumes shown in the table and compare the exponents. Mercury's volume has an exponent of 10, which is the smallest out of all the planets.
Mercury is made mainly of rock. So, the smallest planet is made mainly of rock.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12

It is a mineral. It is a rock. It is a mineral. It is a rock. It is a mineral. It is a rock. It is a mineral. It is a","The right answare is B Fluorite has all the properties of a mineral. So, fluorite is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0885,0.0082,0.2315,0.23

Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 4:1.","The right answare is E To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with white spots or solid coloring, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.
White spots is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
Solid coloring is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with white spots. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with solid coloring.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0149,0.0072,0.1689,0.3333

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer:","The right answare is A The table tells you that Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are the planets made mainly of rock. Of these planets, Earth has the volume with the largest exponent. So, Earth is the largest planet that is made mainly of rock.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of carbon tetrachloride. Carbon tetrachloride was once used in fire extinguishers. It is no longer used because it is poisonous.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The model below represents a molecule of carbon tetrachloride. Carbon tetrachloride was once used in fire extinguishers. It is no longer used because it is poisonous.","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether carbon tetrachloride is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of carbon tetrachloride is composed of one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that carbon tetrachloride is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and chlorine. Since carbon tetrachloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, carbon tetrachloride is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

So, quartz is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0963,0.0092,0.2433,0.2222

Answer: The feather is younger than the bug.","The right answare is A Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The feather fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the ginkgo leaf fossil. So, the feather fossil is most likely younger than the ginkgo leaf fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles because it has a higher concentration of solute.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a golden body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This Punnett square shows a cross between two guppies.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 1:3.","The right answare is C To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a golden body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb. These boxes are highlighted below.
A golden body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a golden body must have the genotype bb.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype bb. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with a gray body for every 1 offspring with a golden body.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0252,0.0131,0.1925,0.3302

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0788,0.0308,0.1821,0.4057

Answer: Calcium oxide is an elementary substance.","omplete the statement. Calcium oxide is ().
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents calcium oxide. Calcium oxide is used to make cement and steel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Calcium oxide is an elementary substance.","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether calcium oxide is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that calcium oxide is composed of oxygen atoms and calcium atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that calcium oxide is composed of two chemical elements: oxygen and calcium. Since calcium oxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, calcium oxide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound rubidium bromide.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles because it has a higher solution volume.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0551,0.0202,0.2088,0.2361
