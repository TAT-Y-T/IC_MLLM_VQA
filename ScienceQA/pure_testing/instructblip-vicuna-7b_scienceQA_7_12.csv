A. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
B. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Gordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Gordon's test in the wind tunnel helped him determine the size of the vent for the parachute. By testing the parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel that simulated the spacecraft's speed of 200 km per hour, Gordon could observe how much the parachute swung. This allowed him to determine whether the vent was too big or too small for the spacecraft's landing requirements.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2888,0.1201,0.2702,0.4835

Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep: The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets. In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep, one with a woolly fleece (Ff) and the other with a hairy fleece (ff). The expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0, meaning that four out of five offspring will have a woolly fleece and only one will have a hairy fleece.

This is because","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.
A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1888,0.0726,0.2401,0.4393

The correct answer is option B: The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnets,","The right answare is C Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5587,0.2542,0.3829,0.5075

Pelecanus rufescens has the same scientific name as a pink-backed pelican. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Balearica pavonina does not have the same scientific name as a pink-backed pelican. So, Pelecanus rufescens and Balearica pavonina are not in the same species.
Tyto alba does not have the same scientific name as a pink-backed pelican. So, Pelecanus rufescens and Tyto alba are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

Hint: In a group of American curl cats, some individuals have curled ears and others have straight ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e). This Punnett square shows a cross between two American curl cats.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: C","The right answare is C Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0235,0.0035,0.1014,0.2551

A. parasitic
B. mutualistic
C. commensal

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.  A rat tapeworm is a type of flatworm that can live inside a rat's body. When a rat eats an insect that has a tapeworm inside it, the insect is digested, but the tapeworm remains alive. The tapeworm is moved into the rat's intestines and uses suckers to attach itself to the intestine wall. Inside the rat's intestine, the tapeworm absorbs nutrients from food that the rat has eaten. If the rat has many tapeworms in its intestines, it will become weak from lack of nutrients. Figure: a tapeworm attached to the wall of an intestine.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The relationship formed when a rat tapeworm attaches itself to a rat's intestine is parasitic.

So, the tapeworm benefits from its relationship with the rat.
The rat loses nutrients from its food to the tapeworm. So, the rat is harmed by its relationship with the tapeworm.
Since the tapeworm benefits and the rat is harmed, a parasitic relationship is formed when a rat tapeworm attaches itself to the intestine of a rat.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Marble is a rock.","The right answare is A The properties of marble match the properties of a rock. So, marble is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0012,0.0002,0.1313,0.21

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Answer: Dolerite is a rock and not a mineral. It is a coarse-grained rock that is not made by organisms and has no fixed crystal structure. It is not a pure substance.","The right answare is B The properties of dolerite match the properties of a rock. So, dolerite is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0266,0.0053,0.224,0.2673

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.  Dakota planted 25 tomato seeds one-half inch below the soil surface in each of six pots. Dakota added an equal amount of fertilizer to three of the six pots. She placed the pots in a plant growth chamber where all the seeds experienced the same temperature, amount of light, and humidity level. After two weeks, Dakota counted the number of seedlings that grew in each pot. She compared the number of seedlings in the pots with fertilizer to the number of seedlings in the pots without fertilizer. Figure: tomato seedlings growing in soil.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Dakota's experiment can best answer the question ""Does the addition of fertilizer to soil affect the number of tomato seedlings that grow?"" Dakota's experiment is a controlled study, meaning that all the seeds experienced the same temperature, amount of light, and humidity level. This allows us to isolate the effect of the fertilizer on the number of seedlings that grow.

Answer: B","bout our solar system true or false? Of the four smallest planets, two are made mainly of gas.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is A To decide which four planets are the smallest, look at the volumes and compare the exponents. The volumes of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars have the smallest exponents. So, these four planets are the smallest.
These four planets are made mainly of rock. So, of the four smallest planets, none are made mainly of gas.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15",0.0083,0.0036,0.1124,0.2073

But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 1:3.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 1:3. This is because the gene for the body size trait has two alleles, one for a normal-sized body (B) and one for a dwarf body (b). The recessive allele for a dwarf body (b) is paired with the dominant allele for a normal-sized body (B) in the","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1026,0.045,0.2403,0.3486

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Charlotte was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Charlotte wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Charlotte put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Charlotte's test showed that adding blade guards to the drones did not significantly affect their flight performance. The guards were made of lightweight metal, which allowed the drones to maintain their agility and maneuverability while still providing protection to the propeller blades. This outcome indicates that the engineering-design process was successful in developing a solution that met the requirements of the design while also addressing the problem of propeller blade damage.

So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The black bear has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree, which is a producer. The black bear also has arrows pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver, which are consumers. The black bear eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.
The gray fox has two arrows pointing to it. These arrows start from the swallowtail caterpillar and the pine vole, which are both consumers.  So, the gray fox is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The pine vole has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree, which is a producer. The pine vole also has an arrow pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar, which is a consumer. The pine vole eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not an omnivore.
The black racer has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the pine vole, which is a consumer. So, the black racer is a consumer but not an omnivore.

Answer: false","bout our solar system true or false? Three-quarters of the planets are larger than Earth.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","The right answare is A To decide which planets are larger than Earth, look at the volumes of the other planets and compare the exponents to the exponent of Earth's volume. Earth's volume is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3. Earth's volume is the only volume with an exponent of 12.
The volumes of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have exponents greater than 12, so these four planets are larger than Earth. There are eight planets total. So, one-half of the planets are larger than Earth.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15",0.0027,0.0013,0.0791,0.1538

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Scoria is a rock, not a mineral. It is a type of volcanic rock that is formed from the solidification of magma. Scoria is a porous rock that contains many small holes and is not a pure substance. It is found in nature and is not made by organisms.","The right answare is A The properties of scoria match the properties of a rock. So, scoria is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0587,0.0121,0.1885,0.29

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a Syrian hamster produced by this cross will have long fur is 3/4.

This is because the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles, one for short fur (F) and one for long fur (f). The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).","The right answare is A Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0693,0.0039,0.1523,0.287

There were no worms in the containers that did not get worms. So, they were part of a control group.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.3381,0.0613,0.1845,0.3978

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","bout our solar system true or false? The volume of Mars is more than ten times as large as Mercury's.
A. true
B. false

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","The right answare is B To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3, which is less than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Mars is less than ten times as large as Mercury's.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0034,0.0018,0.1203,0.2316

Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock,","The right answare is A Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Material that is eroded in nature is called sediment. Sand, mud, and pebbles are all types of sediment. Over time, layers of these sediments can build up in places like riverbeds. The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Conglomerate forms when the bottom layers of sediment are pressed together to form rock.

Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.",0.3657,0.1009,0.3023,0.4091

Answer: The correct answer is D. bat star. The bat star is the decomposer in this food web. It is a filter feeder that consumes plankton, small fish, and other organisms, breaking down their tissues into smaller particles that can be consumed by other organisms in the food web. The bat star plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by recycling nutrients and maintaining the balance of the food web.","The right answare is D Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The bat star does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the bat star is a decomposer.
The sea otter has an arrow pointing from it. So, the sea otter is not a decomposer.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing from it. So, the kelp bass is not a decomposer.
The sea cucumber does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the sea cucumber is a decomposer.
The black rockfish has an arrow pointing from it. So, the black rockfish is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1511,0.028,0.235,0.4082

Answer: The diagram shows the order of fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence. The oldest fossil is the ginkgo leaf, followed by the insect.","The right answare is A Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The ginkgo leaf fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the insect fossil. So, the ginkgo leaf fossil is most likely older than the insect fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

B. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Robert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

The gaps in the scoria rock are","The right answare is A Scoria is an igneous rock. Like other igneous rocks, it forms when melted rock cools and hardens.
Melted rock at the earth's surface is called lava. Scoria forms from a type of lava that is rich in iron and magnesium. As the lava erupts from a volcano, it can trap small bubbles of air or water. When the lava becomes solid, the bubbles leave behind gaps in the rock.

Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each purple ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution B","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Hint: This organism is a gray tree frog. Its scientific name is Hyla versicolor.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is A A gray tree frog's scientific name is Hyla versicolor. The first word of its scientific name is Hyla.
Atelopus zeteki is in the genus Atelopus. The first word of its scientific name is Atelopus. So, Atelopus zeteki and Hyla versicolor are not in the same genus.
Hemidactylus turcicus is in the genus Hemidactylus. The first word of its scientific name is Hemidactylus. So, Hemidactylus turcicus and Hyla versicolor are not in the same genus.
Hyla cinerea is in the genus Hyla. The first word of its scientific name is Hyla. So, Hyla cinerea and Hyla versicolor are in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0011,0.0004,0.1156,0.2405

A. echinoderm
B. cnidarian

Hint: Read the text. Invertebrates make up the majority of Earth's living things, but there are many different groups, or phyla, of invertebrates. Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means ""nettle,"" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean. Another phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning ""spiny"" and ""skin."" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The image of the sea urchin on the rock is a perfect example of an echinoderm, a type of invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Echinodermata. Echinoderms are characterized by their spiny skin, which is made up of tube feet, spines, and a central body. These features help them move, anchor themselves to the ocean floor, and protect themselves from predators.

This conclusion is based on the fact that the magnets in each pair are the same size and shape","The right answare is A Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 2:3. This is because the recessive allele for black fur (f) is paired with the dominant allele for brown fur (F) in the cross. The ratio of offspring with black fur is 2, and the ratio of offspring with brown fur is 3.","The right answare is D To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.
Black fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with black fur for every 1 offspring with brown fur.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0813,0.0346,0.2329,0.3462

A. the sections of wall scrubbed with water and baking soda
B. the sections of wall scrubbed with water only

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.  Luther's young son drew all over the living room wall with crayons! Luther wanted to find a way to remove the crayon markings. Based on what he read online, he decided to see if scrubbing a wall with baking soda could help remove crayon. Luther dipped a sponge in water and used it to scrub the crayon on a small section of the wall. He dipped a second sponge in water, sprinkled it with baking soda, and used it to scrub the crayon on another section of the wall. He observed how much crayon was removed from each section. Luther repeated this test two more times on other sections of the wall. Figure: scrubbing a crayon drawing off a wall.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Luther's reasoning for using baking soda to remove crayon markings from the wall is based on the assumption that the baking soda can act as a mild abrasive, effectively removing the crayon from the wall. This assumption is supported by the fact that baking soda is commonly used as a cleaning agent, particularly for removing tough stains and odors.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.3009,0.0575,0.1848,0.3656

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution B","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Hint: Read the text. Biologists can look at how related two animals are by comparing their body parts, or structures. Analogous structures are parts with the same purpose but with different structures, like a fin and a flipper. Different species may develop analogous structures when they live in similar environments even if they aren't closely related. Homologous structures, however, may show that species are related by indicating they have common ancestors.

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury",0.0001,0.0,0.0677,0.0968

A. the steel squares soaked in salt water
B. the steel squares soaked in salt water and vinegar

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.  Jessica was using steel to make rusted sculptures. After building each sculpture, she caused it to rust by placing it in salt water for eight hours. Jessica wondered if steel would rust faster if she added vinegar to the salt water. Jessica cut ten squares of steel sheet metal. She put five of the squares into a tub filled with salt water. She put the other five squares into a tub filled with salt water mixed with vinegar. Once an hour for eight hours, Jessica counted how many steel squares in each group had rust on them. Figure: a sculpture made from rusted steel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Jessica's experiment is designed to test the effect of vinegar on the rusting process of steel.

B. the steel squares soaked in salt water and vinegar

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.  Jessica was using steel to make rusted sculptures. After building each sculpture, she caused it to rust by placing it in salt water for eight hours. Jessica wondered if steel would rust faster if she added vinegar to the salt water. Jessica cut ten squares of steel sheet metal. She put five of the squares into a tub filled with salt water. She put the other five squares into a tub filled with salt water mixed with vinegar. Once an hour for eight hours, Jessica counted how many steel squares in each group had rust on them. Figure: a sculpture made from rusted steel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Jessica's experiment is designed to test the effect of vinegar on the rusting process of steel. By placing the steel squares in salt water with and without vinegar, she can compare the rate of rust formation between the two groups. The control group, which consists of the squares placed in salt water only, serves as a reference point for comparison.

The steel squares in the salt water group will rust at a normal rate, as salt water is known to accelerate the","The right answare is A In this experiment, Jessica investigated whether adding vinegar to salt water affects how quickly steel squares rust. The steel squares soaked in salt water did not get vinegar. So, they were part of a control group.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.3091,0.0491,0.2061,0.337

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Answer: The diagram shows the order of fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence. The oldest fossil is the crocodile egg, followed by the palm leaf.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The palm leaf fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the crocodile egg fossil. So, the palm leaf fossil is most likely older than the crocodile egg fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0398,0.0051,0.1872,0.2209

Answer: The probability that a muskmelon plant produced by this cross will be homozygous recessive for the fruit taste gene is 2/4. This is because the square with the ff genotype represents the homozygous recessive genotype for the fruit taste gene.","The right answare is C Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.0815,0.0102,0.1532,0.3469

The correct answer is option B: The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnets, the distance","The right answare is C Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.",0.4746,0.2173,0.3869,0.4364

Answer: B","s the Christmas tree worm.
A. Sphodromantis viridis
B. Spirobranchus giganteus
C. Macropus giganteus

Hint: This organism is a Christmas tree worm. Its scientific name is Spirobranchus giganteus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B A Christmas tree worm's scientific name is Spirobranchus giganteus.
Sphodromantis viridis does not have the same scientific name as a Christmas tree worm. So, Spirobranchus giganteus and Sphodromantis viridis are not in the same species.
Macropus giganteus does have the same species within its genus as a Christmas tree worm, but they are not in the same genus! They do not have the same scientific name as each other. So, these organisms are not in the same species.
Spirobranchus giganteus has the same scientific name as a Christmas tree worm. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0016,0.0006,0.1306,0.2143

Answer: Andesite is a rock, not a mineral. It is a type of rock that is made up of coarse and fine mineral grains, and it is found in nature. It is not a pure substance, and it is not made by living things. Andesite does not have a fixed crystal structure, which is a characteristic of minerals.","ndesite a mineral or a rock?
A. mineral
B. rock

Hint: Andesite has the following properties: found in nature solid not a pure substance not made by living things made up of coarse and fine mineral grains no fixed crystal structure

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Andesite is a rock, not a mineral. It is a type of rock that is made up of coarse and fine mineral grains, and it is found in nature. It is not a pure substance, and it is not made by living things. Andesite does not have a fixed crystal structure, which is a characteristic of minerals.","The right answare is B The properties of andesite match the properties of a rock. So, andesite is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0945,0.0251,0.2217,0.3069

A. the number of times the plots were burned each year
B. the number of unwanted grasses

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.  Dr. Spencer was the land manager for a prairie that had become overrun by unwanted grasses. These grasses crowded out other plants. Dr. Spencer thought that she could use fire to remove the unwanted grasses and allow other plants to grow. But she didn't know how often the prairie should be burned. Dr. Spencer marked off six plots within a large area of the prairie. She used carefully controlled fires to burn all of the plants in each plot. She burned three of the plots once a year for three years. She burned the other three plots twice a year for three years. A year after the last fire, Dr. Spencer counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots. Hint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3134,0.0465,0.2041,0.4

A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Hint: The model below represents silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is a hard substance used in car brakes and in bulletproof vests.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether silicon carbide is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that silicon carbide is composed of carbon atoms and silicon atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that silicon carbide is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and silicon. Since silicon carbide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silicon carbide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents the compound pyrite.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.322,0.1391,0.2791,0.4615

The correct answer is option B. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnets and the","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.4699,0.2076,0.3815,0.381

There is one path matter can take from the snowy owl to the earthworm: snowy owl->earthworm.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Emmy was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Emmy wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Emmy put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.

The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Emmy was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Emmy wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Emmy put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have green pods and others have yellow pods. In this group, the gene for the pod color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D). This Punnett square shows a cross between two pea plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 3:1. This is because the recessive allele for yellow pods (d) is present in all four squares, and the dominant allele for green pods (D) is only present in two squares. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods is 3 to 1.","hoose the most likely ratio.

Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 3:1. This is because the recessive allele for yellow pods (d) is present in all four squares, and the dominant allele for green pods (D) is only present in two squares. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods is 3 to 1.","The right answare is C To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.
Yellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.
Green pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0693,0.0302,0.2245,0.3661

Answer: The diagram shows the order of fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence. The oldest fossil is the crocodile egg, followed by the fern.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The fern fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the crocodile egg fossil. So, the fern fossil is most likely older than the crocodile egg fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0345,0.0045,0.1818,0.2118

167,Which term matches the picture?,accuracy | precision,,B,A,"Question: Which term matches the picture?
A. accuracy
B. precision

Hint: Read the text. In the sciences, it's important to distinguish between the accuracy and precision of measurements. Accuracy refers to how close measured values are to a true value. Precision refers to how close measured values are to each other. A common metaphor used to illustrate the difference between these terms is a bull's-eye, or target. Darts thrown accurately at a bull's-eye all hit close to the center of the target but not necessarily close to each other. Darts thrown precisely at a bull's-eye, by contrast, all hit the same spot but not necessarily at the center of the bull's-eye.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The image of a bull's-eye in the context of the question is used to illustrate the difference between accuracy and precision. The bull's-eye is a target that is typically used in darts or other sports where the goal is to hit a specific point. In this case, the bull's-eye represents the center of the target, which is the desired location for the dart to hit.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Stanley, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Stanley thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use. So, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed. Figure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.

The correct answer is option C: The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnetic field they generate","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.4941,0.2217,0.3618,0.4795

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0365,0.0171,0.1983,0.2222

The plants that were only soaked in water were not sprayed. So, they were not part of an experimental group.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.3333,0.0965,0.2212,0.3371

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

Hint: This organism is a black-tailed jackrabbit. Its scientific name is Lepus californicus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is A A black-tailed jackrabbit's scientific name is Lepus californicus.
Lepus californicus has the same scientific name as a black-tailed jackrabbit. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Erinaceus europaeus does not have the same scientific name as a black-tailed jackrabbit. So, Lepus californicus and Erinaceus europaeus are not in the same species.
Sciurus vulgaris does not have the same scientific name as a black-tailed jackrabbit. So, Lepus californicus and Sciurus vulgaris are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Answer: B","omplete the statement. Ethane is ().
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of ethane. Ethane is used to make plastic bags.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether ethane is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of ethane is composed of six hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that ethane is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and carbon. Since ethane is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, ethane is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

The orca has an arrow pointing to it from the sea otter. The sea otter is not a primary consumer. So, the orca is not a secondary consumer.
The kelp bass has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton and the plainfin midshipman. The zooplankton and the plainfin midshipman are primary consumers, so the kelp bass is a secondary consumer.
The black rockfish has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton. The zooplankton is a primary consumer, so the black rockfish is a secondary consumer.
The sea urchin has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is not a primary consumer. So, the sea urchin is not a secondary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1204,0.0263,0.1951,0.3261

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","bout our solar system true or false? Earth's volume is more than ten times as great as Mars's volume.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","The right answare is A To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^12 km^3. So, Earth's volume is less than ten times as great as Mars's volume.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0029,0.0014,0.1203,0.2151

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury",0.0001,0.0,0.0672,0.1038

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.2652,0.0142,0.1859,0.2857

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnetic field they generate, which is proportional to the number of magnetic poles they possess. The number of","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Answer: The American alligator is a species of crocodile that is native to the southeastern United States. It is the largest reptile in the United States and is known for its powerful jaws and sharp teeth.","The right answare is B An American alligator's scientific name is Alligator mississippiensis.
Aequorea victoria does not have the same scientific name as an American alligator. So, Alligator mississippiensis and Aequorea victoria are not in the same species.
Alligator mississippiensis is in the same genus as Alligator sinensis, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Alligator mississippiensis and Alligator sinensis are different species within the same genus.
Alligator mississippiensis has the same scientific name as an American alligator. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of ethanol. Ethanol can be used as a fuel. Most of the gasoline that is used in the United States is about 10% ethanol.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether ethanol is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of ethanol is composed of six hydrogen atoms, two carbon atoms, and one oxygen atom bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that ethanol is composed of three chemical elements: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Since ethanol is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, ethanol is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute particle, represented by a pink ball.

The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.

The process of diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the solute particles are represented by pink balls and","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3663,0.1027,0.2903,0.4848

Answer: C. pathos (emotion)","The right answare is A The ad appeals to logos, or reason. It mentions the results of laboratory tests.

The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury",0.0001,0.0,0.0675,0.0943

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0365,0.0135,0.2066,0.2329

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A mature fern","The right answare is B After they are released, spores can land on the ground and germinate. When a spore germinates, it grows into a heart-shaped plant.
Mature fern plants grow from fertilized eggs.

Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.",0.0058,0.0003,0.1459,0.1798

Answer: The images show two pairs of magnets, each pair consisting of two magnets. The two pairs are labeled as Pair 1 and Pair 2. The question asks which of the three options is true regarding the magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair.

The correct answer is option C. The magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair is the same. This is because the magnets in each pair are made of the same material","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.4652,0.2051,0.3696,0.3387

Answer: Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy than sample B.","The right answare is B The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.211,0.0743,0.2715,0.5122

There are three arrows pointing from the brown lemming to other organisms. One arrow points to the Arctic fox. The only arrow pointing from the Arctic fox leads to the earthworm. The second arrow pointing from the brown lemming leads to the short-tailed weasel. The only arrow pointing from the short-tailed weasel leads to the snowy owl. The only arrow pointing from the snowy owl leads to the earthworm. The third arrow pointing from the brown lemming leads to the parasitic jaeger. The only arrow pointing from the parasitic jaeger leads to the rough-legged hawk. The only arrow pointing from the rough-legged hawk leads to the earthworm. No arrows point from the earthworm to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the brown lemming to the mushroom..

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.0637,0.0118,0.1802,0.2564

Answer: B","s the European nightjar.
A. Caprimulgus europaeus
B. Haliaeetus leucocephalus
C. Ulex europaeus

Hint: This organism is a European nightjar. Its scientific name is Caprimulgus europaeus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is A A European nightjar's scientific name is Caprimulgus europaeus. The first word of its scientific name is Caprimulgus.
Haliaeetus leucocephalus is in the genus Haliaeetus. The first word of its scientific name is Haliaeetus. So, Haliaeetus leucocephalus and Caprimulgus europaeus are not in the same genus.
Ulex europaeus and Caprimulgus europaeus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ulex europaeus and Caprimulgus europaeus have the same species name within their genus, europaeus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ulex europaeus is in the genus Ulex, and Caprimulgus europaeus is in the genus Caprimulgus.
This organism and the European nightjar are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Caprimulgus europaeus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.

232,Which term matches the picture?,operant conditioning | classical conditioning,,A,A,"Question: Which term matches the picture?
A. operant conditioning
B. classical conditioning

Hint: Read the text. A conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning. Operant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The woman in the picture is sitting on the floor with her dog, and the dog is looking up at her. The woman is feeding the dog, which is a conditioned response. The dog has learned to associate the sound of the food being opened with the act of being fed. This is an example of classical conditioning, where the dog has learned to associate two events that were not originally related. The dog's salivation is an unconditioned response, which means it occurs",". operant conditioning

Answer: Solution B","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.

Shelley was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Shelley wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Shelley put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Shelley's test showed that adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly. This is because the guards added weight to the drone, which made it harder for the drone to fly. The guards were designed to protect the propeller blades from damage, but they also added additional weight to the drone, which made it more difficult to maneuver and maintain stability in flight.

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","The right answare is B To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0041,0.0023,0.1313,0.2556

The larger magnet in Pair 1 generates a stronger","The right answare is B Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.5683,0.2428,0.3559,0.5758

A. whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin
B. whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster
C. whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  People with diabetes sometimes take a medicine made from insulin. Insulin can be made by a special type of bacteria. Kathleen was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%.

Hint: This organism is a common kestrel. Its scientific name is Falco tinnunculus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: A","The right answare is A A common kestrel's scientific name is Falco tinnunculus. The first word of its scientific name is Falco.
Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus.
Falco sparverius is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco sparverius and Falco tinnunculus are in the same genus.
Tigrisoma mexicanum is in the genus Tigrisoma. The first word of its scientific name is Tigrisoma. So, Tigrisoma mexicanum and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.0512,0.0123,0.1887,0.3894

A. A flavorant might be both found in nature and made in a chemical factory.
B. A substance's chemical structure depends only on the number and types of atoms in each molecule of the substance.

Hint: A substance's physical and chemical properties are all determined by its chemical structure. Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged. One property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor. Syrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones. Substances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both. One example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two cows, one of which has horns and the other does not. The gene for the horns trait has two alleles, one for having horns (h) and one for not having horns (H). The allele for having horns is recessive to the allele for not having horns, meaning that if a cow has two copies of the recessive allele (HH), it will not have horns","o not have horns?

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two cows, one of which has horns and the other does not. The gene for the horns trait has two alleles, one for having horns (h) and one for not having horns (H). The allele for having horns is recessive to the allele for not having horns, meaning that if a cow has two copies of the recessive allele (HH), it will not have horns","The right answare is E To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have horns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have horns.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.

A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","bout our solar system true or false? The volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","The right answare is B To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Neptune.
Then compare the result to the volume of Uranus. The volume of Uranus is 6.83 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 6.25 x 10^14 km^3. So, the volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0035,0.0023,0.121,0.2105

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.

This is because the dominant allele (L) for black coat color is present in all four squares, while the recessive allele (l) for reddish-brown coat color is only present in two squares. The ratio of 1:3 represents the number of offspring with a black coat (L) to the number of off","The right answare is E To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.
A reddish-brown coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a reddish-brown coat must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
A black coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the dominant version of the coat color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with a reddish-brown coat for every 2 offspring with a black coat.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Sebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour.

The first pair of magnets (Pair 1) has two magnets of the same size, while the second pair (Pair 2) has two magnets of different sizes. The larger magnet in P","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.4685,0.1942,0.3499,0.4865

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The images show two pairs of magnets, each with two magnets of the same material but different shapes. The two pairs of magnets are not interacting with each other, meaning that the magnetic force between them is not affecting the orientation of the magnets.

The two pairs of magnets are labeled as Pair 1 and Pair 2. The question asks which of the three options is true regarding the magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair","bout the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?

The two pairs of magnets are labeled as Pair 1 and Pair 2. The question asks which of the three options is true regarding the magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair","The right answare is A Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.452,0.2185,0.381,0.3704

A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: true","bout our solar system true or false? Neptune's volume is more than 100 times as large as Earth's.
A. false
B. true

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: true","The right answare is A To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 100 times the volume of Earth.
Then compare the result to the volume of Neptune. The volume of Neptune is 6.25 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 1.08 x 10^14 km^3. So, Neptune's volume is less than 100 times as large as Earth's.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18",0.0025,0.0011,0.1146,0.2128

Hint: This organism is a red-billed gull. Its scientific name is Chroicocephalus scopulinus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is C A red-billed gull's scientific name is Chroicocephalus scopulinus.
Chroicocephalus scopulinus has the same scientific name as a red-billed gull. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Haliaeetus leucocephalus does not have the same scientific name as a red-billed gull. So, Chroicocephalus scopulinus and Haliaeetus leucocephalus are not in the same species.
Chroicocephalus scopulinus is in the same genus as Chroicocephalus ridibundus, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Chroicocephalus scopulinus and Chroicocephalus ridibundus are different species within the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0012,0.0004,0.125,0.2222

B. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Mason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Mason's test in the wind tunnel helped him determine the size of the vent for the parachute. By testing the parachute with a 1 m vent at 200 km per hour, he could observe how much the parachute swung. This allowed him to determine if the vent was too big or too small for the spacecraft's landing requirements.

The wind tunnel was an essential tool for this test because it simulated the high-speed wind conditions","ould Mason's test show?

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2879,0.1189,0.2772,0.4778

Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have red fruit and others have yellow fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit color trait has two alleles. The allele for red fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for yellow fruit (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 2:2. This is because the dominant allele (F) for red fruit is present twice, and the recessive allele (f) for yellow fruit is present twice as well. The ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 2:2 because each parent has one copy of the recessive allele (f) for yellow fruit, and each offspring","hoose the most likely ratio.

The allele for red fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for yellow fruit (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 2:2. This is because the dominant allele (F) for red fruit is present twice, and the recessive allele (f) for yellow fruit is present twice as well. The ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 2:2 because each parent has one copy of the recessive allele (f) for yellow fruit, and each offspring","The right answare is D To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.
Yellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
Red fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with yellow fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red fruit.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0987,0.0381,0.2192,0.3853

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0169,0.0036,0.1787,0.2083

The correct answer is option B. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. This is because the magnets in each pair are identical, meaning they have the same magnetic properties","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.",0.4612,0.2039,0.3774,0.3387

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The two pairs of magnets are identical in terms of their material composition, but the size of the magnets in each pair is different. The smaller magnet in Pair 1 has a stronger magnetic force compared to the larger magnet in Pair 1. The larger magnet in Pair 2 has a weaker magnetic force compared to the smaller magnet in Pair 2.

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnetic field they generate, which is proportional","bout the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
A. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
B. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.

Answer: The two pairs of magnets are identical in terms of their material composition, but the size of the magnets in each pair is different. The smaller magnet in Pair 1 has a stronger magnetic force compared to the larger magnet in Pair 1. The larger magnet in Pair 2 has a weaker magnetic force compared to the smaller magnet in Pair 2.

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnetic field they generate, which is proportional","The right answare is C Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5449,0.2321,0.3668,0.5224

300,Which type of relationship is formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby?,commensal | parasitic | mutualistic,,C,A,"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby?
A. commensal
B. parasitic
C. mutualistic

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.  Alpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows. A shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger. Both animals then retreat to the safety of the burrow. Figure: a goby and an alpheid shrimp at the entrance of a burrow.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The relationship between the alpheid shrimp and the goby is mutualistic, meaning that both organisms benefit from the association. The alpheid shrimp benefits from the protection provided by the goby, while the goby benefits from the shrimp's ability to detect predators and alert it to danger.

The alpheid shrimp is a small crustacean that builds burrows in the sand to protect itself from predators. These","n alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby?

The alpheid shrimp benefits from the protection provided by the goby, while the goby benefits from the shrimp's ability to detect predators and alert it to danger.

The alpheid shrimp is a small crustacean that builds burrows in the sand to protect itself from predators. These","The right answare is C When an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby, the goby alerts the shrimp about nearby predators. These alerts help the shrimp survive. So, the shrimp benefits from its relationship with the goby.
The goby also receives protection from predators when it shares the shrimp's burrow. So, the goby also benefits from its relationship with the shrimp.
Since both the shrimp and the goby benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby.

When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.
This table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship.

There are two arrows pointing from the barren-ground caribou to other organisms. One arrow points to the grizzly bear. The only arrow pointing from the grizzly bear leads to the mushroom. The other arrow pointing from the barren-ground caribou leads to the mushroom. No arrows point from the mushroom to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the barren-ground caribou to the earthworm.. There are four paths matter can take from the bilberry to the earthworm: bilberry->Arctic fox->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->Arctic fox->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->snowy owl->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk->earthworm.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1074,0.0188,0.2014,0.3274

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Diodon nicthemerus","The right answare is C A slender-spined porcupinefish's scientific name is Diodon nicthemerus.
Amphiprion frenatus does not have the same scientific name as a slender-spined porcupinefish. So, Diodon nicthemerus and Amphiprion frenatus are not in the same species.
Amphiprion perideraion does not have the same scientific name as a slender-spined porcupinefish. So, Diodon nicthemerus and Amphiprion perideraion are not in the same species.
Diodon nicthemerus has the same scientific name as a slender-spined porcupinefish. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.291,0.0448,0.1827,0.375

Hint: Hematite has the following properties: metallic luster not made by living things fixed crystal structure found in nature solid pure substance

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Hematite is a mineral.","The right answare is B Hematite has all the properties of a mineral. So, hematite is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.001,0.0001,0.1269,0.22

Hint: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies: Most fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs.

Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies, one with normal antennae (a) and the other with mutated antennae (A). The expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 1:3.

The reason for this ratio is based on the dominant and recessive nature of the gene for antennae type. The gene for antennae type has two alleles, one","The right answare is C To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mutated antennae or normal antennae, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for mutated antennae, is dominant over the a allele, which is for normal antennae.
Mutated antennae is the dominant allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the antenna type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with mutated antennae must have the genotype AA or Aa.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal antennae is the recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the antenna type trait must have only recessive alleles for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with normal antennae must have the genotype aa.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with mutated antennae for every 1 offspring with normal antennae.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.2017,0.0643,0.2145,0.4579

Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that potassium bromide is composed of potassium atoms and bromine atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that potassium bromide is composed of two chemical elements: potassium and bromine. Since potassium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium bromide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound potassium chloride.

Answer: Kaylee's test showed that giving extra nutrients to the bacteria did not increase the amount of insulin they produced by 20%. This means that the extra nutrients did not have a significant impact on the bacteria's ability to produce insulin. Therefore, Kaylee's solution of adding extra nutrients to the bacteria did not meet the requirements of the engineering-design process.

The engineering-design process is a","The right answare is B People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3294,0.1448,0.2655,0.4505

Answer: mineral","mineral or a rock?
A. rock
B. mineral

Hint: Hornblende has the following properties: found in nature pure substance dull luster fixed crystal structure solid not made by organisms

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: mineral","The right answare is B Hornblende has all the properties of a mineral. So, hornblende is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0005,0.0001,0.1346,0.22

A. 3:1
B. 0:4
C. 2:2
D. 4:0
E. 1:3

Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats: Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance. In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e). This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two rats, one with normal ears (E) and the other with dumbo ears (e). The expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 3:1. This means that in a cross between two rats, one third of the offspring will have dumbo ears and two thirds will have normal ears.

The expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 3:1. This means that in a cross between two rats, one third of the offspring will have dumbo ears and two thirds will have normal ears.

The Punnett square is a tool used to predict the","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with normal ears.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1914,0.0638,0.2239,0.4324

A. the grasses and the prairie sunflowers
B. the Ord's kangaroo rats
C. the grasses, the water, and the sand dunes

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  The tallest sand dunes in North America are in Colorado. In this desert region, the top few inches of sand are usually dry, but the lower layers remain moist year-round. Ord's kangaroo rats spend their entire lives in these dunes. They collect seeds from grasses and prairie sunflowers, and then bury the seeds in the moist layers of sand. Later, the rats come back to eat their buried seeds. The seeds absorb enough moisture from the sand that the kangaroo rats never need to drink water! Figure: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in Colorado.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Granite is a rock. It is a type of rock that is made up of minerals. It is not made by organisms and it is solid. It is also coarse-grained and has a texture that is found in nature.","The right answare is B The properties of granite match the properties of a rock. So, granite is a rock.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0375,0.0084,0.1774,0.297

Answer: B","The right answare is A A pickerel frog's scientific name is Lithobates palustris. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates.
Lithobates catesbeianus is in the genus Lithobates. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates. So, Lithobates catesbeianus and Lithobates palustris are in the same genus.
Agalychnis callidryas is in the genus Agalychnis. The first word of its scientific name is Agalychnis. So, Agalychnis callidryas and Lithobates palustris are not in the same genus.
Bufo guttatus is in the genus Bufo. The first word of its scientific name is Bufo. So, Bufo guttatus and Lithobates palustris are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

The Punnett square shows that the offspring can have either two normal wings (NN),","The right answare is E Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:

A. Solution A
B. neither; their concentrations are the same
C. Solution B

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0195,0.0058,0.2025,0.2368

Answer: Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy than sample B.","The right answare is A Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.1955,0.0591,0.2555,0.4737

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: false","The right answare is B To decide which planet is the smallest, look at the volumes shown in the table and compare the exponents. Mercury's volume has an exponent of 10, which is the smallest out of all the planets.
Mercury is made mainly of rock. So, the smallest planet is made mainly of rock.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:

A. commensal
B. mutualistic
C. parasitic

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.  Hawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers. To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis. Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce. Figure: a hawk moth visiting a petunia flower.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The relationship formed between a hawk moth and a petunia flower is mutualistic. Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit from the interaction. In this case, the hawk moth benefits from the nectar provided by the petunia flower, while the petunia flower benefits from the pollination provided by the moth.

In this case, the hawk moth benefits from the nectar provided by the petunia flower, while the petunia flower benefits from the pollination provided by the moth.

The hawk moth visits the petunia flower to drink nectar,","The right answare is B When a hawk moth visits a petunia flower, the moth drinks nectar. The moth uses the nectar to survive and grow. So, the moth benefits from its relationship with the petunia.
The petunia flower is pollinated when the moth visits it. After the petunia is pollinated, it is able to reproduce. So, the petunia also benefits from its relationship with the moth.
Since both the moth and the petunia benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a hawk moth pollinates a petunia flower.

When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.
This table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship.

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of phosphine. Phosphine is a poisonous gas that some farmers use to kill insects.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B. an elementary substance","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether phosphine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of phosphine is composed of three hydrogen atoms and one phosphorus atom bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that phosphine is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and phosphorus. Since phosphine is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphine is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.",0.0009,0.0003,0.1158,0.1651

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Answer: The probability that a cockatiel produced by this cross will have bright orange cheeks is 2/4. The gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles, one for bright orange cheeks (R) and one for pale orange cheeks (r). The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).","The right answare is B Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0677,0.0039,0.1476,0.2752

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.",0.4393,0.181,0.3494,0.4074

Why does the Dominican Republic share its island with another country?
The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the island of Hispaniola. It is home to the earliest European settlements in the Americas. Christopher Columbus founded the first European settlement on the island in 1492 during his first voyage across the Atlantic.
Though many people lived on the island before Columbus's arrival, European countries quickly began to colonize the island. Eventually France and Spain both established colonies. The Spanish colony eventually became the country of the Dominican Republic, and the French colony eventually became the country of Haiti.

As the two plates converge, the Juan de Fuca Plate is forced to move underneath the North American Plate, causing the formation of the Cascade Range.","The right answare is C To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Cascade Range, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
The Cascade Range is a volcanic arc in the Pacific Northwest that begins in California and runs north into British Columbia. As the North American Plate and the Juan de Fuca Plate move toward each other, oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts, or sinks, below continental crust of the North American Plate.
There are eighteen volcanoes in the Cascade Range, and some of them are still active. Mount St. Helens is an active volcano near Seattle, Washington. It last erupted in May of 1980.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Cascade Range formed as the two plates moved toward each other. So, the Cascade Range formed at a convergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
ocean-continent subduction zone
One type of convergent boundary is an ocean-continent subduction zone, which forms when a plate with oceanic crust and a plate with continental crust move toward each other. The oceanic crust subducts, or sinks, below the continental crust.
As the oceanic crust subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes called a volcanic arc.",0.3981,0.2939,0.497,0.5564

Answer: The organism in the same species as the Canada lynx is a Canada lynx.","The right answare is C A Canada lynx's scientific name is Lynx canadensis.
Macropus agilis does not have the same scientific name as a Canada lynx. So, Lynx canadensis and Macropus agilis are not in the same species.
Lynx canadensis is in the same genus as Lynx rufus, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Lynx canadensis and Lynx rufus are different species within the same genus.
Lynx canadensis has the same scientific name as a Canada lynx. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Answer: true","bout our solar system true or false? The volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury.
A. true
B. false

Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: true","The right answare is A To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is greater than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles than Solution B.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.045,0.0165,0.2348,0.25

The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.4846,0.2026,0.3721,0.4658

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0365,0.0143,0.1983,0.2222

Answer: The fern is the youngest fossil because it is on top of the sedimentary rock. The palm leaf is the oldest fossil because it is on the bottom of the sedimentary rock.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The palm leaf fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the fern fossil. So, the palm leaf fossil is most likely younger than the fern fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0583,0.006,0.1925,0.2235

The allele for solid coloring is dominant to the allele for white spots, meaning that if a cow has two copies of the solid coloring gene (AA), it will have solid coloring. If","The right answare is B Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.1006,0.0027,0.1667,0.3119

During his observations, Winston counted the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with sunflower seeds and the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with flax seeds. Figure: a cardinal visiting a platform feeder with sunflower seeds.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Winston's experiment can best answer the question ""Do cardinals eat more seeds per visit from feeders containing sunflower seeds compared to feeders containing flax seeds?""

Winston's experiment is designed to compare the number of visits by cardinals to feeders containing sunflower seeds versus those containing flax seeds. By counting the number of visits by cardinals to each type of feeder, Winston can determine whether","The right answare is B Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e). This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 2:2. This is because the dominant allele (E) is present twice, and the recessive allele (e) is present twice as well. The ratio of offspring with red eyes to offspring with black eyes is 1:2, as the dominant allele (E) is present once and the recessive allele (e) is present twice.","lack eyes to offspring with red eyes?

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 2:2. This is because the dominant allele (E) is present twice, and the recessive allele (e) is present twice as well. The ratio of offspring with red eyes to offspring with black eyes is 1:2, as the dominant allele (E) is present once and the recessive allele (e) is present twice.","The right answare is B To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with black eyes. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with red eyes.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0908,0.0382,0.2121,0.3717

There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.",0.4737,0.2205,0.3939,0.4

Hint: This organism is a bobcat. Its scientific name is Lynx rufus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Bobcat","The right answare is A A bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx.
Lynx canadensis is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx canadensis and Lynx rufus are in the same genus.
Macropus rufus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Macropus rufus and Lynx rufus have the same species name within their genus, rufus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Macropus rufus is in the genus Macropus, and Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx.
Python molurus is in the genus Python. The first word of its scientific name is Python. So, Python molurus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Hint: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants: Watermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait. In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G). This Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants, one with a yellow ground spot and the other with a white ground spot. The Punnett square is used to determine the possible combinations of alleles for each trait in the offspring.

In this case, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles: G and g. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground","The right answare is A To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.
A yellow ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.
A white ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype gg.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a white ground spot.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.233,0.0918,0.2747,0.4

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0988,0.006,0.1579,0.3119

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B. a compound","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether hydrazine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of hydrazine is composed of four hydrogen atoms and two nitrogen atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that hydrazine is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and nitrogen. Since hydrazine is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, hydrazine is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.

How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:

Hint: Read the passage and look at the picture. Millions of years ago, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate began to move toward each other, eventually colliding. This plate motion formed many mountain ranges, including the Western Alps. The Western Alps run through European countries, including France, Italy, and Switzerland.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Western Alps are a mountain range that runs through European countries such as France, Italy, and Switzerland.

Answer: The Western Alps are a mountain range that runs through European countries such as France, Italy, and Switzerland. The formation of the Western Alps was caused by the collision of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate. The Eurasian Plate is the larger of the two plates, and it is moving northward towards the African Plate. This collision caused the African Plate to subduct, or sink, beneath the Eurasian Plate. The subduction","The right answare is B To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Western Alps, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
Millions of years ago, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate began to move toward each other, eventually colliding. This plate motion formed many mountain ranges, including the Western Alps. The Western Alps run through European countries, including France, Italy, and Switzerland.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Western Alps formed as the two plates collided, or ran into each other. For two plates to collide, they must be moving toward each other. So, the Western Alps formed at a convergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
One type of convergent boundary is a continent-continent collision. This type of boundary forms when two plates with continental crust move toward each other. The collision compresses and folds the continental crust, forcing it upward to form a mountain range.",0.3449,0.2104,0.3947,0.4909

Answer: B","an produce spores?
A. a mature fern
B. a heart-shaped plant

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is A A mature fern can make spores. Spores grow inside the spore case. When the spore case breaks open, the spores are released.
A heart-shaped plant produces eggs and sperm, not spores.

Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.",0.0017,0.0001,0.113,0.1477

The killer whale is the primary consumer in this food web because it consumes the largest amount of organisms and","The right answare is C Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is not a primary consumer.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton is a producer, so the plainfin midshipman is a primary consumer.
The sea otter has an arrow pointing to it from the sea urchin. The sea urchin is not a producer. So, the sea otter is not a primary consumer.
The kelp does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the kelp is not a primary consumer.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp. The kelp is a producer, so the kelp bass is a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1415,0.0206,0.216,0.3678

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.1043,0.0054,0.1645,0.3394

A. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
B. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Kenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Kenji's test in the wind tunnel was an important step in the engineering-design process. The engineering-design process is a systematic approach to solving problems by creating and testing solutions.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2866,0.1164,0.2669,0.4835

Answer: The diagram shows the order of fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence. The oldest fossil is the ginkgo leaf, followed by the insect, and the youngest is the feather.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The insect fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the ginkgo leaf fossil. So, the insect fossil is most likely younger than the ginkgo leaf fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0536,0.0063,0.1857,0.2235

A. insect
B. ginkgo leaf

Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The diagram shows the order of fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence. The oldest fossil is the insect, followed by the ginkgo leaf.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The ginkgo leaf fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the insect fossil. So, the ginkgo leaf fossil is most likely older than the insect fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0345,0.0045,0.1818,0.2118

The second pair of magnets, labeled as Pair 2, consists of two magnets with different","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.468,0.1697,0.3403,0.4795

Answer: The probability that a Labrador retriever produced by this cross will have brown fur is 2/4. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).","The right answare is C Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.",0.0401,0.0025,0.1311,0.2936

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Joy was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Joy wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Joy put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Joy's test showed that adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly. This is because the guards added weight to the drone, which made it harder for the drone to fly smoothly and efficiently. The guards also made the drone less maneuverable, which could have caused it to crash or collide with obstacles in the warehouse.

The underlined part of the passage explains that the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed as the two plates moved away from each other, or diverged. So, the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed at a divergent boundary.

The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.",0.4339,0.3399,0.5211,0.5461

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Duncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Duncan's test in the wind tunnel helped him determine the size of the vent for the parachute. By testing the parachute with a 1 m vent in the wind tunnel, he could simulate the movement of the parachute at 200 km per hour. This allowed him to observe how much the parachute swung and whether it was too much or not.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Duncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Duncan's test in the wind tunnel helped him determine the size of the vent for the parachute. By testing the parachute with a 1 m vent in the wind tunnel, he could simulate the movement of the parachute at 200 km per hour. This allowed him to observe how much the parachute swung and whether it was too much or not.

The wind tunnel is a device that uses a fan to create a strong, steady stream","The right answare is C People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2954,0.12,0.2697,0.5055

The size of the magnets affects","The right answare is A Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5196,0.2219,0.3714,0.4697

Answer: The diagram shows the order of fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence. The oldest fossil is the fern, followed by the insect.","The right answare is B Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The insect fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the fern fossil. So, the insect fossil is most likely older than the fern fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0295,0.004,0.1762,0.2024

Answer: python reticulatus","The right answare is A A reticulated python's scientific name is Python reticulatus.
Python reticulatus has the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Nerodia cyclopion does not have the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, Python reticulatus and Nerodia cyclopion are not in the same species.
Morelia viridis does not have the same scientific name as a reticulated python. So, Python reticulatus and Morelia viridis are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B. a compound","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether oxygen is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the ball-and-stick model shown above, both of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that red represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol O. So, the model shows you that a molecule of oxygen is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that oxygen is composed of only one chemical element. So, oxygen is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: male cells","The right answare is B Sperm are male cells. Cells that become sperm are found inside the pollen.
Eggs are female cells. The eggs are produced and stored in the ovary.

Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.",0.0038,0.0004,0.1036,0.1789

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.

Answer: C","The right answare is C A Burmese python's scientific name is Python bivittatus. The first word of its scientific name is Python.
This organism and the Burmese python are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Python bivittatus.
Lithobates palustris is in the genus Lithobates. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates. So, Lithobates palustris and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.
Melanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Melanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus have the same species name within their genus, bivittatus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Melanoplus bivittatus is in the genus Melanoplus, and Python bivittatus is in the genus Python.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants: Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs. In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth.

Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants, one with bush growth and the other with climbing growth. The gene for the growth pattern trait in rose plants has two alleles: G and g. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means that if a rose plant has two copies of the recessive allele (gg), it will have bush growth, while a plant with two copies","The right answare is A To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.2056,0.049,0.2036,0.419

Hint: The model below represents gold. Gold is a precious metal that is often used to make jewelry.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B compound","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether gold is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the space-filling model shown above, all of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that yellow represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol Au. So, the model shows you that gold is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that gold is composed of only one chemical element. So, gold is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance zirconium.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. The color of a ball represents a specific chemical element. The atomic symbol for that chemical element is shown in the legend.",0.0011,0.0001,0.1242,0.1596

Answer: B","an happen to a sperm and an egg?
A. They can turn into spores.
B. They can fuse and form fertilized eggs.

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a moss.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B A sperm and an egg can fuse to form a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg then grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part.
The new stalk may make spores, but the sperm and the egg do not turn into spores.

Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Moss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.
The sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.
The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.
When the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again.",0.0071,0.0008,0.1395,0.2697

Answer: seeds","The right answare is B Fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside a fertilized cone.
Pollen grows inside male cones, not fertilized cones.

Gymnosperms are plants that have seeds but not flowers. Conifers are a type of a gymnosperm. Instead of flowers, conifers have cones. Conifers use their cones for sexual reproduction.
Most conifer trees have both male and female cones. The male cones produce pollen. The female cones produce eggs and a sticky substance on the edge of the cone.
Male cones release pollen into the wind. Pollination happens when pollen lands on and sticks to the female cones. Self-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on the same tree. Cross-pollination happens when pollen sticks to a female cone on a different tree.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs at the base of the female cone's scales. This is called fertilization.
The fertilized eggs grow into seeds inside the female cone. Conifer seeds are released from the fertilized cones. Many conifer seeds have wing-like structures. They can be carried long distances by the wind. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow cones and begin the conifer life cycle again.",0.0003,0.0,0.0759,0.129

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.3092,0.0401,0.1976,0.3191

The wood fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the palm leaf fossil. So, the wood fossil is most likely older than the palm leaf fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.",0.3099,0.0477,0.1995,0.3368

Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B Unlike sperm and eggs, spores do not fuse.
After they are released, spores can land on the ground and germinate. When a spore germinates, it grows into a heart-shaped plant.

Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.",0.016,0.0029,0.1564,0.2667

Hint: In a group of sheep, some individuals have white wool and others have black wool. In this group, the gene for the wool color trait has two alleles. The allele for white wool (L) is dominant over the allele for black wool (l). This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The probability that a sheep produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the wool color gene is 2/4. This is because the square with the L on it represents the dominant allele, and there are two of them. The square with the l on it represents the recessive allele, and there is only one of them.

Therefore, the probability that a sheep produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the wool color gene","The right answare is C Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?
How do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.
If both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.
If both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.
In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. 
Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
Consider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:
number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4",0.1458,0.0214,0.1786,0.3571

For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0178,0.0038,0.1872,0.2083

Pair 1 consists of two magnets with their north poles facing each other, while Pair 2 consists of two magnets with their south poles facing each other.","The right answare is C Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.",0.4294,0.1929,0.3571,0.3818

Hint: Fluorite has the following properties: found in nature solid pure substance not made by living things fixed crystal structure glassy luster

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Fluorite is a mineral","The right answare is B Fluorite has all the properties of a mineral. So, fluorite is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.001,0.0001,0.1329,0.22

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 3:1. This is because the recessive allele for white spots (a) is paired with the dominant allele for solid coloring (A) in the cross. The offspring will inherit one allele from each parent, and since the dominant allele is paired with the recessive one, the offspring will have solid coloring. The ratio of offspring","oloring?

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 3:1. This is because the recessive allele for white spots (a) is paired with the dominant allele for solid coloring (A) in the cross. The offspring will inherit one allele from each parent, and since the dominant allele is paired with the recessive one, the offspring will have solid coloring. The ratio of offspring","The right answare is E To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with white spots or solid coloring, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.
White spots is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
Solid coloring is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with white spots. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with solid coloring.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0872,0.0328,0.2355,0.3694

Answer: true","The right answare is A The table tells you that Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are the planets made mainly of rock. Of these planets, Earth has the volume with the largest exponent. So, Earth is the largest planet that is made mainly of rock.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.

C. commensal

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.  Alcon blue butterflies spend the first part of their lives as caterpillars that live with Myrmica ants. When a caterpillar lives with the ants, it mimics, or pretends to be, an ant. The caterpillar can mimic the ants by copying their smell. The caterpillar can also make noises that make it sound like a queen ant. Queen ants receive more food and better protection than any other ants in the nest. So, when the caterpillar mimics an ant, the ants feed and protect the caterpillar instead of other ants in the nest. Figure: a Myrmica ant caring for an Alcon blue caterpillar.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Alcon blue caterpillar forms a mutualistic relationship with the Myrmica ants. Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit from the interaction. In this case, the caterpillar benefits from the ants' protection and food, while the ants benefit from the caterpillar's mimicry, which helps the ants identify it as a fellow ant.

Answer: B","omplete the statement. Carbon tetrachloride is ().
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of carbon tetrachloride. Carbon tetrachloride was once used in fire extinguishers. It is no longer used because it is poisonous.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether carbon tetrachloride is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of carbon tetrachloride is composed of one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that carbon tetrachloride is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and chlorine. Since carbon tetrachloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, carbon tetrachloride is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

Hint: Quartz has the following properties: solid not made by living things naturally occurring white streak fixed crystal structure made of a pure substance called silica

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Quartz is a mineral.","The right answare is A Quartz has all the properties of a mineral. So, quartz is a mineral.

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",0.0018,0.0002,0.1373,0.2121

Answer: The feather is the youngest fossil in the sequence because it is the most recent","nswer.
A. feather
B. ginkgo leaf

Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The feather is the youngest fossil in the sequence because it is the most recent","The right answare is A Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The feather fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the ginkgo leaf fossil. So, the feather fossil is most likely younger than the ginkgo leaf fossil.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers.",0.0144,0.0014,0.1441,0.1905

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles than Solution B.","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0437,0.0188,0.2041,0.2222

Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a golden body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This Punnett square shows a cross between two guppies.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 1:3.","The right answare is C To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a golden body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb. These boxes are highlighted below.
A golden body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a golden body must have the genotype bb.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype bb. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with a gray body for every 1 offspring with a golden body.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.0252,0.0131,0.1925,0.3302

In a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.
An event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:
probability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes
You can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.

The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Kenny was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Kenny thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area. Figure: studying an architect's design.

A. 1:3
B. 4:0
C. 3:1
D. 2:2
E. 0:4

Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies: Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study. In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies, one with normal wings (N) and the other with vestigial wings (n). The expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 1:3. This ratio is determined by the recessive nature of the vestigial wing allele (n) and the dominant nature of the normal wing allele (N).

The expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 1:3. This ratio is determined by the recessive nature of the vestigial wing allele (n) and the dominant nature of the normal wing allele (N).

In a cross between two individuals, each parent","The right answare is D To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.
Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.",0.1701,0.0574,0.2164,0.434

Answer: B","omplete the statement. Calcium oxide is ().
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents calcium oxide. Calcium oxide is used to make cement and steel.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B Use the model to determine whether calcium oxide is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that calcium oxide is composed of oxygen atoms and calcium atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that calcium oxide is composed of two chemical elements: oxygen and calcium. Since calcium oxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, calcium oxide is a compound.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound rubidium bromide.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.
