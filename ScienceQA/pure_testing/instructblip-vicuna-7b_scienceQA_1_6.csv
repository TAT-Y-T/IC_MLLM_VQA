Answer: The correct answer is B. mushroom. The correct answer is B. mushroom. The food web in the image shows that the matter eaten by the arctic fox is passed on to the arctic hare, which in turn is eaten by the arctic wolf. The arctic wolf is then eaten by the arctic fox. The mushroom is not part of this food web, but it is present in the ecosystem. The","The right answare is B Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the lichen.
No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the lichen to the bilberry.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.2327,0.0381,0.2567,0.3529

It is a herbivore that feeds on phytoplankton, algae, and other small aquatic plants. The black crappie is a crucial link in the food chain, as it consumes the smaller organisms and provides food for other organisms in the ecos","The right answare is A Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The rotifer has an arrow pointing to it from the green algae. The green algae is a producer, so the rotifer is a primary consumer.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the golden algae. The golden algae is a producer, so the copepod is a primary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea, the rotifer, and the shiner. None of these organisms is a produce, so the black crappie is not a primary consumer.
The bacteria have arrows pointing to them from the copepod and the shiner. Neither the copepod nor the shiner is a producer, so the bacteria are not primary consumers.

The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together.",0.3964,0.1772,0.3467,0.4615

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3125,0.0348,0.2222,0.4066

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0006,0.0,0.1218,0.1467

Answer: The picture shows a desert in Asia. A desert is an environment that does not get much rain or snow. The sandstone is more likely to form from sediment deposited in a desert because it is a sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation of sand and other sediment. Shale is also a sedimentary rock, but it forms from layers of mud, not sand.","The right answare is A Sandstone is likely to form from sediment deposited in a desert.
Shale forms from layers of mud. Mud is usually deposited by water. Since deserts are dry environments, mud is rarely found in deserts.

Material that is carried by wind, water, or ice is called sediment. Sand and mud are examples of sediment. Sediment may be deposited, or laid down, in places such as deserts and the ocean floor.
Over time, sediment can be pressed together to form sedimentary rock. You can observe a sedimentary rock to learn about the environment in which the sediment was deposited.
Each type of sediment forms a different sedimentary rock. Here are some examples of sedimentary rocks:
Sandstone forms from sand. Sand is usually deposited by wind in deserts and by water on beaches.
Shale and mudstone form from mud. Mud is often deposited at the bottom of oceans and deep lakes.
Limestone forms from sediment made mostly of the shells of marine organisms. This type of sediment is often deposited in the ocean near coral reefs.
Conglomerate forms from sediment of many different sizes, such as mud, sand, pebbles, and boulders. This type of sediment is usually carried by glaciers and fast-flowing rivers. The sediment can be deposited when a glacier melts or a river starts moving more slowly.",0.1823,0.059,0.2289,0.25

The bird's beak is pointed and curved, making it well-suited for capturing insects. The bird's eyes are also positioned on the sides of its head, allowing it to see in all directions while it hunts.","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the common nighthawk.
A short, thin beak is light and easy to move. The common nighthawk uses its beak to grab fast-moving insects while flying.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The barn swallow has a short, thin beak. Its beak is adapted to catch insects.
The hanging parrot has a small hooked beak. Its beak is not adapted to catch insects. The hanging parrot uses its beak to eat fruit and seeds.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",0.2702,0.0633,0.2143,0.3111

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.122,0.008,0.1727,0.1954

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: repel","The right answare is B To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.001,0.0,0.1215,0.1692

The green algae is a decomposer, meaning it plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by breaking down organic matter and recycling nut","The right answare is B Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The water mold does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the water mold is a decomposer.
The bacteria do not have arrows pointing from them to other organisms. So, the bacteria are decomposers.
The green algae has arrows pointing from it. So, the green algae is not a decomposer.
The golden algae has an arrow pointing from it. So, the golden algae is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1932,0.0364,0.2311,0.4227

Answer: repel","ttract or repel each other?
A. repel
B. attract

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: repel","The right answare is A To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0006,0.0,0.1218,0.1467

So, in this food web, matter does not move from the sea cucumber to the bat star..

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.112,0.0162,0.1875,0.3302

The scarlet macaw's beak is adapted to crack open large, hard nuts, which are a significant part of its diet. The beak is strong and curved, allowing the bird to easily","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the scarlet macaw.
The scarlet macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The scarlet macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The African gray parrot has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts.
The white-tipped sicklebill has a long, thin, curved beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The white-tipped sicklebill uses its beak to drink nectar out of long flowers.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",0.2842,0.088,0.25,0.3579

C. Solution B

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles than Solution B.","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0437,0.0157,0.1959,0.2329

Answer: Palaeopython is a type of snake that lived in trees and could grow more than six feet long. The fossil in the picture shows the snake's body, which is long and thin, and its skin, which has black stripes.","The right answare is C The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.1236,0.0197,0.1678,0.2584

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: yes","The right answare is B Sphalerite has all the properties of a mineral. So, sphalerite is a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3096,0.1302,0.2653,0.4444

If you pour water from a glass into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Answer: repel","ttract or repel each other?
A. attract
B. repel

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: repel","The right answare is A To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
Both poles of each magnet line up with both poles of the other magnet. The south pole of each magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0005,0.0,0.1231,0.1515

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.143,0.0126,0.169,0.2558

B. a gas
C. a solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: a gas","The right answare is C A rubber balloon is a solid. You can bend a balloon. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

The horned viper also has a distinctive pattern of black and white scales on its body, which helps it to blend in with the shadows cast by the sun","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the horned viper.
The horned viper has sand-colored scales covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in a sandy desert. The word camouflage means to blend in.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The Namaqua chameleon has sand-colored scales covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in a sandy desert.
The fire salamander has brightly colored skin. It is not adapted to be camouflaged in a sandy desert.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm. Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators.",0.3768,0.1385,0.2465,0.3882

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3458,0.0363,0.2018,0.3778

Falco novaeseelandiae is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco novaeseelandiae and Falco tinnunculus are in the same genus.
Haliaeetus pelagicus is in the genus Haliaeetus. The first word of its scientific name is Haliaeetus. So, Haliaeetus pelagicus and Falco tinnunculus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0008,0.0003,0.1168,0.2308

Answer: C","The right answare is B There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

Answer: The magnets will repel each other","The right answare is A Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.023,0.0053,0.1809,0.2576

After","The right answare is B Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.1947,0.0051,0.1488,0.2262

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnetic field they generate, as well as the distance between them. The strength of the magnetic field is determined by the size and shape of the magnet,","The right answare is A The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5247,0.2279,0.3622,0.5205

For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.
The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. No arrow points to the lichen. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the barren-ground caribou.
No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the bilberry.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.2223,0.0535,0.2644,0.4

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute particle, represented by a pink ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane, which is permeable to the solute particles. The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.

The process of diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the solute particles are represented by pink balls and","The right answare is B Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3695,0.1029,0.2944,0.4851

A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0031,0.0012,0.1309,0.225

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Answer: Solution B","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.

This is a characteristic of herbivores, or plant eaters, as they have teeth and jaws that are designed to break down and process plant material. The kudu is a herbivore, and its mouth is an important tool for it to surv","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the kudu.
The kudu has long jaws and flat teeth. Its mouth is adapted to eat plant matter. The long jaws can help the kudu reach leaves and shoots. The flat teeth can help it cut and grind up the food into soft pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The spotted deer has long jaws and flat teeth. Its mouth is adapted to eat plant matter.
The Nile crocodile has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is not adapted to eat plant matter. The Nile crocodile uses its mouth to eat other animals.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.",0.2604,0.0665,0.2278,0.3478

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:

There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.4529,0.1878,0.3404,0.3818

Larus michahellis does not have the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Larus michahellis are not in the same species.
Goura victoria does not have the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Goura victoria are not in the same species.
Cyanocitta cristata has the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

A. He heard a report on the radio warning about a volcanic eruption.
B. He saw a nearby boat that was on fire.
C. He smelled sulfur and saw pieces of molten rock shooting out of the water.

Hint: Before sunrise on November 14, 1963, the crew of the fishing boat Isleifur II had just finished putting their fishing lines in the ocean off the southern coast of Iceland. As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away. The captain of the Isleifur II first thought the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. But as the Isleifur II approached the column of smoke, the captain and crew saw glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat.

When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together.",0.3902,0.1675,0.3458,0.4423

A. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
B. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Jennifer and Scarlett were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test. They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used. Figure: preparing a concrete slump test.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3118,0.1311,0.2699,0.4333

Answer: liquid","coffee mug a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a gas
B. a liquid
C. a solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: liquid","The right answare is C A coffee mug is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
When you pour coffee into a coffee mug, the mug keeps its shape. If you drop a coffee mug, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Answer: Solution B","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

The saddle-billed stork is a bird that lives near wetlands and lakes, and it primarily feeds on fish.

The saddle","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the saddle-billed stork.
The saddle-billed stork has a long neck. Its neck is adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still. This allows the saddle-billed stork to grab the prey without scaring it away.

The black-headed heron has a long neck. Its neck is adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still.
The northern pintail has a short neck. Its neck is not adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large frilled neck might help an animal appear dangerous to its predators. A long neck might help an animal get food from tall trees.",0.4517,0.2212,0.2909,0.4598

The correct answer is option C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. This is because the magnets in each pair are made of the same material and are of the","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.4605,0.2029,0.3686,0.3492

The first pair of magnets, labeled as Pair 1, has two magnets with the same size. The second pair, labeled as Pair 2, has two magnets with different","The right answare is B Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5233,0.2292,0.3615,0.4697

The process of diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the solute particles are represented by green","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 5 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3752,0.1042,0.2869,0.4902

Answer: C","The right answare is B The equator is the line at 0° latitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Europe or North America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The images show two pairs of magnets, each with two magnets of different sizes. The smaller magnets in Pair 1 are placed on top of the larger magnets in Pair 2. The magnetic force between the magnets in each pair is the same, regardless of the size of the magnets.

The magnetic force between two magnets is proportional to the strength of the magnets and the distance between them. The strength of the magnets is determined by the number","The right answare is A Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5739,0.2485,0.3746,0.5152

A. Solution B
B. Solution A
C. neither; their concentrations are the same

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution B","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0169,0.0035,0.1702,0.2083

Answer: The short-tailed weasel is a small mammal that is adapted to live in cold, snowy areas in Europe. It is a carnivorous animal that preys on small rodents and other small animals. The short-tailed weasel is known for its ability to blend in with its surroundings, particularly in snowy environments, making it difficult for prey to detect. The animal's white fur and black eyes make it appear like a","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the short-tailed weasel.
During the winter, the short-tailed weasel has white fur covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in the snow. The word camouflage means to blend in.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
During the winter, the Arctic fox has white fur covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in the snow.
This screech owl has gray and brown feathers on its skin. It is not adapted to be camouflaged in the snow.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm. Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators.",0.2793,0.1017,0.23,0.3371

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

Answer: The bird in the picture is a common swift, which is a bird that is known for its ability to catch insects and other small invertebrates. The bird's beak is adapted to this purpose, with a pointed shape that allows it to capture its prey with ease. The common swift is a bird that is often found in the skies, soaring and gliding through the air in search of food.","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the common swift.
A short, thin beak is light and easy to move. The common swift uses its beak to grab fast-moving insects while flying.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The barn swallow has a short, thin beak. Its beak is adapted to catch insects.
The hanging parrot has a small hooked beak. Its beak is not adapted to catch insects. The hanging parrot uses its beak to eat fruit and seeds.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",0.3277,0.073,0.216,0.3516

Answer: A","The right answare is B A tawny owl's scientific name is Strix aluco. The first word of its scientific name is Strix.
Goura cristata is in the genus Goura. The first word of its scientific name is Goura. So, Goura cristata and Strix aluco are not in the same genus.
This organism and the tawny owl are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Strix aluco.
Cyanocitta cristata is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Strix aluco are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0011,0.0003,0.1319,0.2308

The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.

The process of diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the yellow balls represent the solute particles, which are moving","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3735,0.1021,0.2978,0.4902

A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.0005,0.0002,0.1088,0.2346

A. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
B. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Kathleen and Susan were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test. They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used. Figure: preparing a concrete slump test.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The slump test is a common method used to determine the workability of fresh concrete. It measures the ability of the concrete to flow and consolidate under its own weight. The test involves pouring a small amount of fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone, also known as a slump cone. The cone is left in place for a specified amount of time, usually 30 seconds, and then lifted to observe the shape of the concrete. If the concrete has a good","ould Kathleen and Susan's test show?

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3096,0.1302,0.2653,0.4444

The presence of the benches in the water suggests that the flood has reached a level that has submerged them.","The right answare is A Evidence is information that tells you something happened.
How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.2015,0.0132,0.1558,0.2442

Answer: a liquid","The right answare is A The bubbles in soda are filled with carbon dioxide gas. Carbon dioxide gas spreads out to fill a space.
Carbon dioxide fills all the space inside the bubbles. If the bubbles pop at the surface of the soda, the carbon dioxide will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

The bearded dragon's neck is elongated and flexible, allowing it to move its head in a way that makes it appear more impos","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the bearded dragon.
When frightened, the bearded dragon can spread out its hood to appear larger and more dangerous. If a predator is nearby, the hood can help scare it away.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The spectacled cobra has a hood around its neck. It uses its neck to appear larger and more dangerous to a predator.
The lace monitor has a narrow neck. Its neck is not adapted to help it appear larger and more dangerous to a predator.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large frilled neck might help an animal appear dangerous to its predators. A long neck might help an animal get food from tall trees.",0.3382,0.0772,0.2635,0.3605

Answer: C","The right answare is C H is the symbol for hydrogen. O is the symbol for oxygen. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and O. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There are two oxygen atoms, so O will have a subscript of 2.
The correct formula is H2 O2.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.0338,0.0703

By comparing the darkness of the linen","The right answare is B Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.245,0.006,0.1677,0.2619

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: a gas","ir moving through a trombone a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a gas
B. a solid
C. a liquid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: a gas","The right answare is A The air moving through a trombone is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air in a trombone expands to fill all the space inside the trombone. When air leaves the trombone, the air expands to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",0.0002,0.0,0.1262,0.0891

The leopard's mouth is adapted to tear through meat, as it is a powerful and sharp instrument that allows the animal to efficiently consume its prey. The leopard's teeth are designed to tear and shred flesh, making it a formidable predator in the wild.","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the leopard.
The leopard has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The leopard uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The Eurasian lynx has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The aardvark has a long tube-shaped mouth and a few, small teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The aardvark uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.",0.1927,0.0627,0.2405,0.3043

So, the mutation in the CLCN1 gene affected the structure and function of the chloride channel protein.

An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.
An organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.",0.2734,0.1009,0.2673,0.4737

B. sample B
C. neither; the samples have the same temperature

Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The sample with the higher temperature is sample A.","The right answare is B The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.",0.2122,0.0477,0.274,0.4878

Hint: This organism is a North American beaver. Its scientific name is Castor canadensis.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The organism is a North American beaver.","The right answare is A A North American beaver's scientific name is Castor canadensis. The first word of its scientific name is Castor.
This organism and the North American beaver are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Castor canadensis.
Strix varia is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix varia and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus.
Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis have the same species name within their genus, canadensis. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ovis canadensis is in the genus Ovis, and Castor canadensis is in the genus Castor.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: BF3","The right answare is A B is the symbol for boron. F is the symbol for fluorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one boron atom and three fluorine atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols B and F. There is one boron atom, so B will not have a subscript. There are three fluorine atoms, so F will have a subscript of 3.
The correct formula is BF3.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.0388,0.0726

Answer: repel","The right answare is B To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0005,0.0,0.1117,0.1579

The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Sandstone forms when the bottom layers of sand are pressed together to form rock.

Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.",0.4093,0.1133,0.2286,0.4762

A. no
B. yes

Hint: Pyrite has the following properties: solid found in nature pure substance fixed crystal structure not made by organisms

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: yes","The right answare is B Pyrite has all the properties of a mineral. So, pyrite is a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.0019,0.0003,0.1564,0.2471

Answer: A","The right answare is B A comet moth's scientific name is Argema mittrei.
Argema mittrei has the same scientific name as a comet moth. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Sphodromantis viridis does not have the same scientific name as a comet moth. So, Argema mittrei and Sphodromantis viridis are not in the same species.
Acanthaster planci does not have the same scientific name as a comet moth. So, Argema mittrei and Acanthaster planci are not in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

The solution is divided into two halves by the membrane, which is dotted in the diagram. The diagram also shows that the solute particles can move across the membrane in both directions, but more solute particles move from the side with a higher concentration to the side with a lower concentration.

The process of diffusion is a continuous movement of","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3704,0.1545,0.3489,0.4848

The arrows in the food web indicate the flow of matter through the ecosystem, with the arrow pointing from the kelp bass to zooplankton. This means that the kelp bass is a predator that feeds on zooplankton,","The right answare is A Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The zooplankton has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the phytoplankton. So, the zooplankton is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer. The kelp bass also has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton and the plainfin midshipman, which are both consumers. The kelp bass eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.

A food web is a model.
Models can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.
A living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.
A living thing in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the living thing eats more than one other living thing in the food web.",0.1789,0.0453,0.2528,0.3409

The fruit can grow around the seeds. But the fruit does not make seeds. Both the fruit and the seeds grow from parts of the flower.

Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",0.1247,0.0222,0.2479,0.2958

This organism and the spot-billed pelican are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Pelecanus philippensis.
Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Pelecanus philippensis are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: C","The right answare is C The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.0252,0.0056,0.1265,0.2022

Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test. They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used. Figure: preparing a concrete slump test.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The slump test is a common method used to determine the workability of fresh concrete. It measures the ability of the concrete to flow and consolidate under its own weight. The test involves pouring a small amount of fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone, also known as a slump cone. The cone is left in place for a specified amount of time, usually 30 seconds, and then lifted to observe the shape of the concrete. If the concrete has a good","ould Camille and Lucy's test show?

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3096,0.1302,0.2653,0.4444

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.0027,0.0004,0.1285,0.2235

Choice ""Jun"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Jul"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Aug"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Oct"" is incorrect.
Choice ""June, July, and August are the driest months of the year."" is incorrect.
On average, slightly more precipitation falls during June, July, and August than during the other months of the year. So, June, July, and August are not the driest months.
Choice ""The wettest months of the year are June, July, and August."" is incorrect.
On average, more precipitation falls during June, July, and August than during other months of the year. So, June, July, and August are the wettest months.
Choice ""October is the wettest month."" is incorrect.
Every other month has a higher average precipitation than October. So, October is the driest, not the wettest, month.

Scientists record climate data from places around the world. Precipitation, or rain and snow, is one type of climate data. Scientists collect data over many years. They can use this data to calculate the average precipitation for each month. The average precipitation can be used to describe the climate of a location.

The absence of water in the riverbed and the flatness of the ground are both indicators of a drought.","The right answare is A Evidence is information that tells you something happened.
How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.1246,0.0046,0.1549,0.1628

It is a crucial food source for the barren-ground caribou, which is a large herbivore that plays a significant role","The right answare is B Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the earthworm.
Arrows point from the barren-ground caribou to the grizzly bear and the mushroom. The only arrow pointing from the grizzly bear leads to the mushroom. No arrows point from the mushroom to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the barren-ground caribou to the earthworm.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1879,0.0311,0.2333,0.3191

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

The process of diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the yellow balls represent the solute particles, which are moving","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.367,0.1011,0.2938,0.4848

Camelus bactrianus is in the genus Camelus. The first word of its scientific name is Camelus. So, Camelus bactrianus and Macropus rufus are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

Answer: The correct answer is B. Plainfin midshipman is an omnivore. The plainfin midshipman is a small fish that is a part of the food web in the Monterey Bay ecosystem. It is an omnivore, meaning it eats both plants and animals. The food web in the Monterey Bay ecosystem is a model that shows how the matter eaten by living things moves through the ecosystem. The arrows in","The right answare is B Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is a producer, not an omnivore.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton, which is a producer. The plainfin midshipman also has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton, which is a consumer. The plainfin midshipman eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.

A food web is a model.
Models can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.
A living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.
A living thing in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the living thing eats more than one other living thing in the food web.",0.2076,0.055,0.2573,0.3563

The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5486,0.2611,0.3757,0.5075

Answer: a gas","The right answare is C The air inside a basketball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air fills all the space inside the basketball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

C. neither; their concentrations are the same

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.0365,0.0135,0.1983,0.2222

Answer: C","The right answare is A The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Europe. It does not intersect North America or Australia.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

B. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
C. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.

Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The images show two pairs of magnets, each with two magnets of different sizes. The two pairs are labeled as Pair 1 and Pair 2. The question asks which of the three options is true regarding the magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair.

The correct answer is option B: The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnetic field","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.5069,0.2379,0.3646,0.4595

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3096,0.1302,0.2694,0.4505

Answer: a solid","The right answare is B Wind through a tree is air that is moving! Air is a gas. The air expands to fill the space around each tree branch.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

The leopard's teeth and jaw are strong enough to tear through the tough hide and muscle of its prey. The leopard's mouth is also equipped","The right answare is A Look at the picture of the leopard.
The leopard has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The leopard uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The orca has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The tamandua has a long tube-shaped mouth and no teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The tamandua uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.",0.2112,0.0678,0.232,0.2921

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles than Solution B.","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute particle, represented by a yellow ball.

The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.

The process of diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the yellow balls represent the solute particles, which are moving","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3638,0.1009,0.2938,0.4848

A. no
B. yes

Hint: Granite has the following properties: not made by living things no fixed crystal structure naturally occurring not a pure substance solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: No","The right answare is A Granite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, granite is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.0027,0.0004,0.1285,0.2118

The lichen does not have an arrow pointing to it. So, the lichen is a producer.
The barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. So, the barren-ground caribou is a consumer, not a producer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Pair 1 has a distance of 15 cm between the two magnets, while Pair 2 has a distance of 18 cm between the two magnets. The magnetic force between the magnets in each pair is proportional","The right answare is C Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.521,0.2167,0.3804,0.3818

Atelopus zeteki has the same scientific name as a Panamanian golden frog. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A","The right answare is B In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

The only difference between the two pairs is the shape of the magnets, which does not affect the magnetic force between them.

The two pairs of magnets are arranged in a way that allows us to compare the magnetic force between them. The first pair (Pair","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.",0.4536,0.1783,0.3869,0.4194

C. neither; their concentrations are the same

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution B","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Answer: A","The right answare is B A gray heron's scientific name is Ardea cinerea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.
Lissotriton helveticus is in the genus Lissotriton. The first word of its scientific name is Lissotriton. So, Lissotriton helveticus and Ardea cinerea are not in the same genus.
This organism and the gray heron are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Ardea cinerea.
Hyla cinerea and Ardea cinerea are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Hyla cinerea and Ardea cinerea have the same species name within their genus, cinerea. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Hyla cinerea is in the genus Hyla, and Ardea cinerea is in the genus Ardea.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

Answer: solid","The right answare is B A bowling ball is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A bowling ball can knock down bowling pins. But after it hits the pins, the bowling ball still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

The weather in Las Vegas is described as clear and sunny, with an average of 300 days of clear skies per year. This is due to the desert climate of the area, which is characterized by hot and dry summers and mild winters. The climate of Las Vegas is also influenced by the surrounding mountains, which can create a micro","The right answare is B Read the passage carefully.
Las Vegas is in the desert. On average, Las Vegas has almost 300 clear, sunny days each year!
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the usual pattern of cloud cover in Las Vegas. This passage does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate.

The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures.",0.5034,0.302,0.3662,0.443

The Arctic fox is the first consumer in the food web, as it consumes the small rodents and plays a crucial role in controlling their populations. The Arctic fox is also a predator of the rough-legged hawk,","The right answare is A Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The mushroom has arrows pointing to it from the barren-ground caribou and the grizzly bear. Neither the barren-ground caribou nor the grizzly bear is a producer, so the earthworm is not a primary consumer.
The Arctic fox has an arrow pointing to it from the bilberry. The bilberry is a producer, so the Arctic fox is a primary consumer.
The barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. The lichen is a producer, so the barren-ground caribou is a primary consumer.
The rough-legged hawk has an arrow pointing to it from the parasitic jaeger. The parasitic jaeger is not a producer, so the rough-legged hawk is not a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1353,0.0256,0.2135,0.3474

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: No","The right answare is B Diamond has all the properties of a mineral. So, diamond is a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.0077,0.0011,0.1429,0.2588

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3096,0.1302,0.2653,0.4444

The mouth of the bull shark is wider than that of other sharks, and its teeth are designed to tear through flesh and bone. This makes it a formidable predator in the ocean, capable of feeding on a variety of prey including turtles, birds, dolphins, and other fish.","The right answare is B Look at the picture of the bull shark.
The bull shark has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted for tearing through meat. The bull shark uses its teeth to cut up meat into pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The barracuda has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted for tearing through meat.
The copperband butterflyfish has a small, narrow mouth. Its mouth is not adapted for tearing through meat.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1767,0.0391,0.2456,0.3505

Ictinia mississippiensis is in the genus Ictinia. The first word of its scientific name is Ictinia. So, Ictinia mississippiensis and Macropus agilis are not in the same genus.
This organism and the agile wallaby are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Macropus agilis.
Lacerta agilis and Macropus agilis are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Lacerta agilis and Macropus agilis have the same species name within their genus, agilis. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Lacerta agilis is in the genus Lacerta, and Macropus agilis is in the genus Macropus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.

The solution is divided into two halves by the membrane, which is dotted in the diagram. The diagram also shows that the solute particles can move across the membrane in both directions, but more solute particles move across the membrane in the direction from left to right.

The process of diffusion is a continuous movement of particles from an","The right answare is B Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3601,0.1049,0.313,0.466

Answer: liquid","The right answare is B Fruit punch is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour fruit punch into a cup, the punch will take the shape of the cup. But the punch will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: PCl5N","The right answare is B P is the symbol for phosphorus. Cl is the symbol for chlorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one phosphorus atom and five chlorine atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols P and Cl. There is one phosphorus atom, so P will not have a subscript. There are five chlorine atoms, so Cl will have a subscript of 5.
The correct formula is PCl5.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.034,0.072

Answer: a liquid","The right answare is B The air inside a bubble is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air inside a bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Shale is a sedimentary rock that forms when layers of mud are pressed together to form rock. It is often found near underground deposits of fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal.","The right answare is A Shale is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Mud is a type of sediment. It is found in places like lakes and oceans. Sediments like mud usually build up in layers. Over time, the top layers press down on the bottom layers. Sedimentary rock can form when the bottom layers are pressed together to form rock.

Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by heating and squeezing. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.",0.316,0.1014,0.3042,0.2973

Answer: The diagram shows a solution with one solute particle, represented by a purple ball.

The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.

The process of diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the solute particles are represented by the purple balls","The right answare is A Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3759,0.1039,0.2984,0.4804

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Answer: solid","The right answare is B A handsaw is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
The handle of this handsaw is made of wood, and the blade is made of metal. Both wood and metal are solids.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the sea cucumber.There is one path matter can take from the kelp to the sea cucumber: kelp->sea urchin->sea otter->orca->sea cucumber. kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp bass to the sea cucumber.. bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bat star to the sea cucumber.. There are two paths matter can take from the phytoplankton to the sea cucumber: phytoplankton->plainfin midshipman->sea cucumber. phytoplankton->zooplankton->plainfin midshipman->sea cucumber.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1614,0.0346,0.2278,0.3365

Hint: This picture shows a fossil of an animal called Holophagus. Holophagus lived in the ocean and gave birth to live young.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: C","The right answare is A The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.0334,0.0075,0.1333,0.1932

Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles.","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Answer: a gas","ir from a hair dryer a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
A. a gas
B. a solid
C. a liquid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: a gas","The right answare is A The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

A. to act like kittens
B. to talk to other cats
C. to talk to people

Hint: Read the text about cat meows. While kittens meow to their mothers, they stop once they are old enough to take care of themselves. At that point, cats use smell, touch, and body language to talk to each other. So if adult cats aren't making noise for each other, why do cats meow? Cats meow to talk with their humans! If you are a cat owner, you may be interested in understanding your cat's meows. Different meows can have distinct meanings. A short, high squeak or chirp is a cheerful hello. A louder and longer meow is a cat's way of saying ""Please?"" or ""Let me out!"" An even longer and louder meow is your cat's way of demanding something, like ""Food! Now!"" Of course, the best cat sound to many cat owners is a low, rumbling purr that comes from a happy cat.

B. a compound

Hint: The model below represents a molecule of iodine. odine is found in some types of disinfectants.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: compound","The right answare is A Use the model to determine whether iodine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the ball-and-stick model shown above, both of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that dark purple represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol I. So, the model shows you that a molecule of iodine is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that iodine is composed of only one chemical element. So, iodine is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.",0.0005,0.0002,0.1153,0.1584

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles","The right answare is C In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of pink particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

A. They can communicate with many kinds of animals.
B. They can communicate about specific problems.
C. They can understand some human speech.

Hint: Read the text about bats. Several kinds of animals ""talk"" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal ""languages,"" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues. Researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages. What Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another. The researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The reason why fruit bats are different from most other animals is that they have a unique way of communicating with one another. Unlike most animals, which communicate with their entire group, fruit bats have the ability to direct their calls to a specific individual. This is a remarkable ability, as it requires a level of sophistication and understanding of the other bat's behavior and needs.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: B","The right answare is B A great gray owl's scientific name is Strix nebulosa. The first word of its scientific name is Strix.
Cyanocitta stelleri is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta stelleri and Strix nebulosa are not in the same genus.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Strix nebulosa are in the same genus.
Cyanocitta cristata is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Strix nebulosa are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

The correct answer is option C: The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

This conclusion is based on the fact that the magnets in each pair are the same size and shape","The right answare is B The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.491,0.1982,0.3529,0.4932

The grassland ecosystem is characterized by the presence of grasses, shrubs, and other plants that provide","The right answare is C In this food chain, the katydid is a primary consumer because it eats a producer. The producer in this food chain is the slender wheatgrass.

Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!",0.2,0.0668,0.2428,0.2805

These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Tyto alba and Ardea alba have the same species name within their genus, alba. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Tyto alba is in the genus Tyto, and Ardea alba is in the genus Ardea.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution B","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Answer: a gas","The right answare is B The air inside a soccer ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air fills all the space inside the soccer ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

These start from the phytoplankton and the zooplankton. The only arrow pointing to the zooplankton starts from the phytoplankton. No arrow points to the phytoplankton. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp to the plainfin midshipman..

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.1434,0.0385,0.2236,0.3465

Answer: repel","ttract or repel each other?
A. attract
B. repel

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: repel","The right answare is B To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0006,0.0,0.1218,0.1579

Hint: This organism is a great egret. Its scientific name is Ardea alba.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Ardea alba","The right answare is A A great egret's scientific name is Ardea alba. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.
Tyto alba and Ardea alba are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Tyto alba and Ardea alba have the same species name within their genus, alba. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Tyto alba is in the genus Tyto, and Ardea alba is in the genus Ardea.
This organism and the great egret are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Ardea alba.
Diodon nicthemerus is in the genus Diodon. The first word of its scientific name is Diodon. So, Diodon nicthemerus and Ardea alba are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Answer: No","The right answare is B Paper does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, paper is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

Caden was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Caden wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather. So, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C. Figure: a weather station.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Caden's test is an example of the engineering-design process, which is a systematic approach to solving problems. The engineering-design process involves several steps, including problem definition, research, design, prototyping, testing, and evaluation. In this case, Caden is using the testing step to ensure that his weather station will work properly even in extremely warm conditions.

The first step in the engineering-design process is problem definition, where the problem is identified and the","The right answare is B People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3425,0.1494,0.2772,0.4835

Answer: solid","The right answare is C A stuffed hippo is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
When you hold a stuffed hippo in your hands, the stuffed hippo still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Kamal used  to launch a ball across a football field. He measured the distance the football traveled and then launched the next ball. Kamal repeated this with all 20 balls. Hint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure. Figure: a football launcher.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The independent variable in this experiment is the air pressure of the footballs, specifically the difference between the air pressure of the ten footballs that were fully inflated to 13 pounds per square inch and the ten footballs that were inflated to 10 pounds per square inch. The dependent variable is the distance the footballs traveled when launched using the football launcher.

The purpose of the experiment is to determine whether the air pressure of the footballs affects","The right answare is A Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3117,0.0272,0.1814,0.3111

Answer: H2S","hemical formula for this molecule.
A. H3S2
B. He2S2
C. H2S
D. H2SN

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: H2S","The right answare is C H is the symbol for hydrogen. S is the symbol for sulfur. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and S. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There is one sulfur atom, so S will not have a subscript.
The correct formula is H2 S.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.0,0.0,0.0339,0.0703

Hint: This drawing shows the skeleton of an ancient animal called Ichthyornis. This drawing was made by looking at the animal's fossils.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The skeleton of Ichthyornis is shown in the drawing.","The right answare is B The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.0337,0.0026,0.1569,0.191
1221,"Based on the arrows, which of the following organisms is a decomposer?",earthworm | bilberry,,A,B,"Question: Based on the arrows, which of the following organisms is a decomposer?
A. earthworm

Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada. A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The correct answer is B. bilberry. The bilberry is a plant that is a decomposer in the food web. It is a shrub that is found in the tundra ecosystem and is an important part of the food chain. The bilberry plays a role in breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the soil, making it an essential component of the ecosystem.","ased on the arrows, which of the following organisms is a decomposer?

Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada. A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: The correct answer is B. bilberry. The bilberry is a plant that is a decomposer in the food web. It is a shrub that is found in the tundra ecosystem and is an important part of the food chain. The bilberry plays a role in breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the soil, making it an essential component of the ecosystem.","The right answare is A Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The earthworm does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the earthworm is a decomposer.
The bilberry has arrows pointing from it. So, the bilberry is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.2109,0.0355,0.2438,0.3111

Answer: solid","The right answare is A A ballet shoe is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

The magnetic field strength of a magnet is proportional to the number of magnetic poles it has. A magnet with more poles will generate a stronger magnetic field than","The right answare is C The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.5084,0.2175,0.3463,0.5135

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: C","The right answare is C The equator is the line at 0° latitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or Europe.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3096,0.1302,0.2653,0.4444

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Answer: C","The right answare is A The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects the Atlantic Ocean. It does not intersect the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

C. a gas

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: solid","The right answare is A An icicle is a solid. An icicle can melt. But when an icicle is frozen, it has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: repel","ttract or repel each other?
A. repel
B. attract

Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: repel","The right answare is A To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.0006,0.0,0.1218,0.1467

Hint: Candle wax has the following properties: no fixed crystal structure made in a factory mixture of different fats solid

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: no","The right answare is A Candle wax does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, candle wax is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3397,0.1457,0.2737,0.5

The number of earthworms added to the soil is the independent variable because it is the variable that is manipulated or changed in the experiment, and its effect is being investigated. The dependent variable is the number of leaves","The right answare is A Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.4102,0.0946,0.282,0.5

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.",0.001,0.0,0.1215,0.1692

Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: Solution B","The right answare is A In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of blue particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Answer: The brown trout is a secondary consumer because it eats a secondary consumer.","The right answare is B In this food chain, the brown trout is a secondary consumer because it eats a primary consumer. The primary consumer in this food chain is the midge larva.

Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!",0.0358,0.0156,0.2034,0.2289

A. endoskeleton
B. exoskeleton

Hint: Read the text. All animals that live on land have some sort of skeletal system. Some animals have what is called an endoskeleton. They have a system of connected bones inside their bodies. This skeleton grows as the animal grows. This helps to support a larger body. Other animals have what is called an exoskeleton. An exoskeleton is a hard covering on the outside of an animal's body. Exoskeletons do not change size, so they must be shed and replaced as an animal grows.

The dependent variable in this experiment is the number of","The right answare is A Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.",0.3221,0.0393,0.2072,0.3778

So, the mutation in the KRT13 gene affected the structure and function of the keratin protein.

An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.
An organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.",0.2904,0.0962,0.259,0.5091

Then, explain your reasoning in detail. 
Answer: a gas","The right answare is A The helium in balloons is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The helium in balloons expands to fill all the space inside the balloons. If a balloon pops, the helium will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.5096,0.2144,0.3641,0.4795

If you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0001,0.0,0.0893,0.0833
