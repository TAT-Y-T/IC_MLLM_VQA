Which of these organisms contains matter that was once part of the lichen?,"bilberry
mushroom",1,1,mushroom,"B. mushroom

Matter cycles through an ecosystem. Organisms are connected within the cycle by arrows that point to the organism that eats matter from another.
The arrow starts with the producer. A producer makes its own matter using carbon dioxide and water. The producer is connected to the matter it eats. An arrow points from each producer to the matter it eats.
Of the choices, the mushroom contains matter that was once part of the lichen. The mushroom has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen.
The bilberry does not have an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. Therefore, the bilberry does not contain matter that was once part of the lichen.","mushroom

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.17748100128298003,0.026361305448958934,0.40540540066928415,0.3055555555555556
Which property do these three objects have in common?,"shiny
slippery
opaque",2,2,opaque,"Answer: C
Explanation: A shiny property means that an object reflects a lot of light. The tortoise shell, crown, and basketball are all opaque. This means that they reflect some of the light that strikes them.
An object is slippery if it is hard to hold onto or stand on. The tortoise shell and basketball are both slippery.
Opacity is the property of being able or not to be seen through. All of the objects shown are opaque. This means that they are all visible through.

A tortoise shell is the hard outer covering of a tortoise. Some people use tortoise shells to make decorative objects.
A crown is a large, decorative hat. Kings and queens wear crowns.
A basketball is a ball used in the sport of basketball. Players try to throw the ball through a hoop to score points.","A shiny property means that an object reflects a lot of light.

For each object, decide if it has that property.
An opaque object does not let light through. All three objects are opaque.
A slippery object is hard to hold onto or stand on. The tortoise shell and the basketball are not slippery.
A shiny object reflects a lot of light. You can usually see your reflection in a shiny object. The crown is shiny, but the basketball is not.
The property that all three objects have in common is opaque.

An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Properties can also tell you how an object will behave when something happens to it.
Different objects can have properties in common. You can use these properties to put objects into groups. Grouping objects by their properties is called classification.",0.4162840730732091,0.1602159032979644,0.4785276023711845,0.5161290322580645

Which of the following organisms is the primary consumer in this food web?,"copepod
black crappie
bacteria",0,0,copepod,"Answer: A
Explanation: In this food web, golden algae and green algae are producers. Organisms that eat producers are primary consumers.
Look at the arrow starting from the golden algae. It points to a different organism. This arrow shows that the golden algae is a producer that is eaten by a primary consumer.
Now, look at the other arrows starting from the golden algae. They point to copepods, rotifers, and water fleas. This shows that the golden algae is eaten by these primary consumers. So, the primary consumers in this food web are copepods, rotifers, and water fleas.

A food web is a model.
A model is a representation of something. Models can be made of nearly any material. Models help you understand things that are too big, too small, or too complicated to otherwise see or use.
There are two main types of models:
1. Physical models are three-dimensional models of something. They do not have moving parts.
2. Mathematical models use math to describe a system. Biological systems can be described with mathematical models.
Models can help you learn about objects and processes. For example, a mathematical model might predict the growth of a population. Scientists can test the prediction against real data to decide if the model works. If the prediction doesn't match the real data well, the scientists will change the model. They then test the new model against the real data. They repeat this process until the model predicts the real data well. When a model works well, it can be useful for making predictions about the object or process that was built as a model.","In this food web, golden algae and green algae are producers.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.
The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",1,1,The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.,"B

Explanation: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them.

Which of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?,"the temperature of the heating pad
the number of days until a seed germinated",1,1,the number of days until a seed germinated,"Answer: B
Explanation: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.

Cells are the structures that make up organisms. Organisms can be made of one cell or many cells. All organisms are made of cells.
The cell theory is a group of ideas about cells. The cell theory states that:
1. All living things are made of one or more cells.
2. A cell is the smallest unit that can form a living thing.
3. All cells come from existing cells.

There are two main types of cells. Plant cells are structured differently from animal cells.
- Plant cells have features like chloroplasts, which allow the plant to photosynthesize.
- Animal cells do not have chloroplasts, but they do have features like flagella, which allow the animal to move.","Rafflesia arnoldii is a plant. Like all plants, Rafflesia arnoldii is made of many cells.

Will these magnets attract or repel each other?,"repel
attract",0,0,repel,"Answer: A
Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel. 

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, the magnets repel each other.

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, the magnets repel each other.
Magnets A and C repel each other. Magnets B and C attract each other.","Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.

Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Ardea goliath are in the same genus.
Falco sparverius is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco sparverius and Ardea goliath are not in the same genus.
Tigrisoma mexicanum is in the genus Tigrisoma. The first word of its scientific name is Tigrisoma. So, Tigrisoma mexicanum and Ardea goliath are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.02713064332509725,0.0026431758441731678,0.2790697627306052,0.17142857142857143

Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",3.2732196212341997e-07,2.864422662700631e-07,0.2040816305039567,0.0967741935483871

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",2,2,The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.,"Answer: C
Explanation: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
The magnets in both pairs are the same distance apart. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are closer together.","The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel.

Which rock is more likely to form from sediment deposited in a desert?,"Sandstone forms from layers of sand.
Shale forms from layers of mud.",0,0,Sandstone forms from layers of sand.,"Answer: A
Explanation: Sandstone forms from layers of sand.
Many rock types form when layers of sediment are compressed and cemented together. This usually happens in two ways:
1. Layers of sedimentary rock can build up in a place called a sedimentary basin. A sedimentary basin is a large area where layers of sediment are trapped between layers of rock. Over time, the layers of sediment in a sedimentary basin get compressed. Compressing the layers makes them smaller. The compressing layers also cement the layers together. The cements hold the layers together as one rock type.
2. Sediment can also be compressed and cemented together while it is under the ground. This can happen in many places:
a volcano is cooling
an area of rock is being pushed down by other rocks above it
an area of rock is being pushed together with other rocks
The rock picture shows layers of sediment that have been compressed and cemented together. So, the rock is probably sandstone.

A rock type is determined by its texture and its composition. These are the two things you observe about a rock to classify it.
Rock type starts with observing texture. Rock texture is the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral or glassy grains in a rock. You can see the rock's texture by looking at its surface.
After you have observed a rock's texture, identify its composition. Rock composition is all the minerals and glassy substances in a rock. Each mineral and glassy substance looks different under a microscope.
These ideas can help you list the steps for identifying rock types:
1. Observe the rock's texture.
2. Identify the rock's composition by looking at a sample under a microscope.
3. Match the rock's texture and composition to named rock types.","Sandstone forms from layers of sand.

Shale forms from layers of mud. Mud is usually deposited by water. Since deserts are dry environments, mud is rarely found in deserts.

Material that is carried by wind, water, or ice is called sediment. Sand and mud are examples of sediment. Sediment may be deposited, or laid down, in places such as deserts and the ocean floor.
Over time, sediment can be pressed together to form sedimentary rock. You can observe a sedimentary rock to learn about the environment in which the sediment was deposited.
Each type of sediment forms a different sedimentary rock. Here are some examples of sedimentary rocks:
Sandstone forms from sand. Sand is usually deposited by wind in deserts and by water on beaches.
Shale and mudstone form from mud. Mud is often deposited at the bottom of oceans and deep lakes.
Limestone forms from sediment made mostly of the shells of marine organisms. This type of sediment is often deposited in the ocean near coral reefs.
Conglomerate forms from sediment of many different sizes, such as mud, sand, pebbles, and boulders. This type of sediment is usually carried by glaciers and fast-flowing rivers.

Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?",1,1,Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?,"Answer: B
Explanation: Look at the information given about Linda and Bob's experiment.
Linda applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of her snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Bob timed each ride. Linda and Bob calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax.
The outcome of Linda and Bob's experiment was that the snowboard slid down the hill in less time when it had a thin layer of wax than when it did not have a thin layer of wax. This means that the snowboard slid down the hill in less time when it had a thin layer of wax on it. So, the experiment can be used to answer the question ""Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?""

An experiment can be designed to answer a specific question. How can you identify the question that an experiment can be designed to answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what changed in the experiment and what stayed the same. The question the experiment answers is likely to be about the part that changed in the experiment.
Imagine that you want to find out if plants grow to different heights when grown with different amounts of water. You might set up an experiment with three groups of 10 plants.

If you can find such a series, then that choice is a decomposer. There is a series of arrows ending on the bat star. This shows how matter moves through this ecosystem. Therefore, the bat star is a decomposer.","Decomposers help break down dead living things into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other living things grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another living thing to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another living thing.
The kelp has an arrow pointing from it. So, the kelp is not a decomposer.
The bat star does not have arrows pointing from it to other living things. So, the bat star is a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
Models can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.
A living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A
sample B",1,1,sample A,"Answer: B
Explanation: The particles in both samples have different amounts of kinetic energy. Their kinetic energies are related to their masses and their speeds. Use the relationship between a particle's mass and its kinetic energy to find which sample has the higher temperature.
If two particles have the same speed and the masses of the particles are different, the particle with the greater mass has the greater kinetic energy.
The particles in Sample A have greater mass than the particles in Sample B. So, the particles in Sample A have greater kinetic energy than the particles in Sample B.
Kinetic energy is directly proportional to mass when speed is constant. Therefore, the difference in mass directly leads to a difference in temperature when speed is held constant.
Sample A has the greater mass of particles, so it has the greater kinetic energy per particle.
Kinetic energy is directly proportional to speed when mass is constant. Therefore, the difference in speed directly leads to a difference in temperature when mass is held constant.
Although the speed of the particles in Sample B is less than the speed of the particles in Sample A, the difference in speed is not as great as the difference in mass. So, the increase in kinetic energy due to the greater speed in Sample B is offset by the decrease in kinetic energy due to the smaller mass. Thus, Sample A still has the greater kinetic energy per particle.
Because the particles in a sample with higher temperature have, on average, greater kinetic energy than the particles in a sample with lower temperature, Sample A has the higher temperature.

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud

Explanation: An arrow points from the organism that is eaten to the organism that is eating. Follow the arrow starting from the earthworm. The arrow points from the earthworm to the barren-ground caribou. Barren-ground caribou eat earthworms, so barren-ground caribou are consumers.

Every organism needs matter to stay alive. Organisms get their matter by eating other organisms.
The arrows in a food web point from the organism that is eaten to the organism that is eating. An arrow starting at an organism means that the organism is getting matter by eating. An arrow pointing to an organism means that the organism is eating matter by eating the organism that the arrow is starting at.

"In this food chain, the yucca moth is a consumer. Why?","It makes its own food.
It eats another living thing.",1,1,It eats another living thing.,"Answer: B
Explanation: A food chain starts with a producer and a consumer. Producers make their own food through photosynthesis. Consumers make their food by eating other organisms.
Organisms make different types of food chains in different ecosystems. This food chain is from a desert ecosystem in Southern California.
Mojave yucca is a producer. Like other plants, it makes its food through photosynthesis.
Yucca moth and scorpion are consumers. They make their food by eating other organisms.
This yucca moth eats the pollen and nectar of the mojave yucca flower. So, the yucca moth is a consumer.
The yucca moth also helps the mojave yucca reproduce. As it moves from flower to flower, the yucca moth carries pollen on its body. The pollen falls on the mojave yucca's stigma. This helps the pollen combine with the mojave yucca's eggs to form a embryo.
The scorpion eats the yucca moth. So, the scorpion is a consumer.
A scorpion makes its food by eating an organism, such as the yucca moth.","A food chain starts with a producer and a consumer. Producers make their own food through photosynthesis. Consumers make their food by eating other organisms.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample A
sample B
neither; the samples have the same temperature",1,1,sample B,"Answer: B
Explanation: The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy. Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, on average, the particles in sample B have a higher kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

An object's temperature tells you how hot or cold it is. Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the object. An object's particles have higher average kinetic energy if the object is hotter.
Heat always moves from hotter objects to colder objects. After heat moves from one object to another, both objects have the same temperature.","The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance.

Explanation: The magnets are pulling toward each other. So, they will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Attracting poles are north-south poles. The north pole of one magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet.
Repelling poles are north-north poles or south-south poles. The north pole of one magnet is repelled by the north pole of another magnet.","The magnets are pulling toward each other. So, they will attract each other.

Explanation: The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The average kinetic energy of the particles is determined by their mass and speed. For a substance to have a high average kinetic energy, each particle in the substance must have a high speed or a large mass, or both.
The mass of each particle in Sample B is greater than the mass of each particle in Sample A. Both samples have the same average particle speed. Therefore, each particle in Sample B has a greater average kinetic energy than each particle in Sample A.
So, the particles in Sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in Sample A. This means that the sample B has the higher temperature.","The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance.

And they were either dyed black or they were not dyed at all. So the fabric squares acted as the variable in Kira's experiment.","Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.17713410418651337,0.005132000637853894,0.2159090859194216,0.0

Which animal's mouth is also adapted to tear through meat?,"tiger
marmot",0,0,tiger,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the picture of the cougars.
Cats have teeth that are adapted to tear through meat. Cats have long, sharp teeth near the front of their mouths. These teeth can tear through flesh easily. Cats have short, sharp teeth near the back of their mouths. These teeth can chop up food easily.

The cat has teeth that are adapted to tear through meat. Cats have long, sharp teeth near the front of their mouths. These teeth can tear through flesh easily.
The marmot does not have teeth adapted to tear through meat. The marmot has short, wide teeth. These teeth are adapted to crush plant materials.

An animal's external features are called adaptations. Adaptations can help an animal use its environment for protection, finding a mate, or finding food.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one of its adaptations. An animal's mouth is adapted in different ways. For example, an animal's mouth may be adapted to tear, chew, or suck with its mouth. Or it can be adapted for swimming or holding on to food.","Look at the picture of the cougars.

Is the water in a sink a solid or a liquid?,"a liquid
a solid",0,0,a liquid,"Answer: A
Explanation: The water in the sink is a liquid. It can flow and take the shape of its container.

There are two states of matter. They are matter in the state of a solid and in the state of a liquid.
In a solid, particles are closely arranged. They have a size and a shape.
In a liquid, particles can move past each other. They do not have a shape. They can take the shape of their container.","The water in the sink is a liquid. It can flow and take the shape of its container.

When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.

Explanation: In this food web, the water mold is the decomposer. It breaks down the matter in dead organisms and waste products. The matter then can be used by other organisms.

A food web models how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem. Arrows show how matter moves from one organism to another. Use the arrows and the labels to understand the relationships in this food web.
Matter cycles through a food web. For each organism, the matter in its body comes from other organisms and the non-living environment. An arrow in a food web always points from the organism that provides matter to the organism that uses it.","In this food web, the water mold is the decomposer.

An arrow in a food web always points from the organism that provides matter to the organism that uses it.","Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The water mold does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the water mold is a decomposer.
The bacteria do not have arrows pointing from them to other organisms. So, the bacteria are decomposers.
The green algae has arrows pointing from it. So, the green algae is not a decomposer.
The golden algae has an arrow pointing from it. So, the golden algae is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.11675305880822102,0.03529246267549326,0.4999999952704165,0.32558139534883723
Which animal is also adapted to be camouflaged in the snow?,"Arctic hare
camel",0,0,Arctic hare,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the picture of the polar bear.
The polar bear is white. It is adapted to be camouflaged in the snow. The polar bear's white fur helps it blend in with its snowy environment. Now look at the other animals. The camel has yellow and white fur. It is not adapted to be camouflaged in the snow.

Camouflage is an adaptation in which an organism's colors or patterns help it blend in with its environment. Organisms with camouflage may be more likely than other similar organisms to survive and reproduce. Changes in an environment may affect which adaptations are beneficial and how successful an organism is in surviving and reproducing.
An environment includes all the biotic, or living, and abiotic, or nonliving, things in the area. The environment of a tundra plant is the tundra. The tundra is cold and has little rain or snow. Plants that grow there are adapted to these conditions.

Will these magnets attract or repel each other?,"repel
attract",0,1,attract,"Answer: B
Explanation: The magnets will attract each other because the opposite poles are facing each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

"In this food web, which organism contains matter that eventually moves to the bat star?","sea cucumber
sea otter
phytoplankton",2,0,sea cucumber,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the arrow starting from the bat star. This arrow points to the sea cucumber. The sea cucumber contains matter that moves to the bat star.
Matter moves through this food web when organisms eat each other. For each organism, write down the organisms that it eats. This is the matter that moves into this organism.
For example, the sea urchin eats the kelp. So, the kelp contains matter that moves to the sea urchin.
The sea cucumber contains matter that moves to the bat star.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If each organism in a food web was shown with all of its connections to other organisms, the food web would be hard to understand.
Using arrows to show food chains helps make food webs easier to understand. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. An organism in a food chain can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

The length of a bird's beak can be adapted to the bird's diet. Passport has a short beak. It is adapted to eat seeds.","Look at the picture of the scarlet macaw.
The scarlet macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The scarlet macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The African gray parrot has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts.
The white-tipped sicklebill has a long, thin, curved beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The white-tipped sicklebill uses its beak to drink nectar out of long flowers.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",0.07165112401661021,0.02592459659891243,0.38297871927971433,0.1836734693877551

The concentration of particles in a solution depends on the volume of the solvent and the number of particles of solute in the solvent. In Solution A and Solution B, the number of particles of solute is equal. However, Solution B has a greater solvent volume than Solution A. So, Solution B has a lower concentration of particles than Solution A.
You can use math to find the concentration of particles in each solution. Remember that concentration depends on the number of particles of solute in a given volume of solvent. So, you need to find the number of particles of solute in each solution.
There are 5 particles of solute in 50 mL of solvent in Solution A.
There are 10 particles of solute in 50 mL of solvent in Solution B.
5 particles of solute are in a smaller volume of solvent than 10 particles of solute. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of particles than Solution B.","The more concentrated a solution is, the higher its concentration of particles is.

There are 10 particles of solute in 50 mL of solvent in Solution B.
5 particles of solute are in a smaller volume of solvent than 10 particles of solute. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of particles than Solution B.","In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.5421052631578948,0.2052439698661705,0.45714285228979595,0.3

Which trait did Palaeopython have? Select the trait you can observe on the fossil.,"black stripes on its skin
large fins on its body
a long, thin body",2,2,"a long, thin body","C. a long, thin body

Explanation: A fossil is the remaining evidence of an organism from the past. Fossils can consist of whole fossils or parts of fossils. The whole fossil of an organism is the complete remains of the organism from the past. Fossils of parts of an organism include bones, shells, and even casts. A cast is formed when the remaining spaces of a fossil are filled with another material, like cement. 
Some fossils look very similar to modern-day organisms. Other fossils are very different from any modern-day organisms. Scientists use fossils to learn about the organisms that lived in the past and how they changed over time. This fossil is a whole fossil. You can tell this is a whole fossil of Palaeopython because it has a long, thin body.
Fossils can tell us what life was like a long time ago. Fossils of certain animals, like Palaeopython, are only found in rocks that are very old. This means Palaeopython lived a very long time ago.","a long, thin body

Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.40107023274467457,0.058483556315807185,0.3666666616722222,0.30303030303030304
Is sphalerite a mineral?,"no

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.07588668643170711,0.044058368751062754,0.3779527521359044,0.20588235294117646

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.
The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",2,0,The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.,"Answer: A
Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart.
Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Which of the following could Marcy and Brenda's test show?,"if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry",0,0,if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use,"Answer: A
Explanation: People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The steps of this process are commonly described using the acronym PDCA, where P stands for plan, D stands for do, C stands for check, and A stands for act.
When engineers test a solution, they might:
- Use measurements to collect data that helps them check their results.
- Compare their results to their predictions.
- Use their results to make new predictions.
- Use their results to ask new questions.
Marcy and Brenda's slump tests were part of the do step of the PDCA cycle. Slump tests help Marcy and Brenda check whether each batch of concrete is firm enough to use. If some of the batches have slump test results that are not acceptable, Marcy and Brenda can make new predictions or ask new questions based on the results. Then, they can plan and do new tests.

Explanation: Bertholletia excelsa is not made up of one cell. Bertholletia excelsa is a plant. Like other plants, Bertholletia excelsa is made of many cells. It is too small to see individual cells without magnification.

Organisms are living things that include both animals and plants. Organisms are made of one or more cells. Cells are the building blocks of these organisms.
An organism may be:
- made of a single cell,
- made up of trillions of cells, or
- in between these two extremes.

Which animal's skin is better adapted as a warning sign to ward off predators?,"lichen katydid
opalescent nudibranch",1,1,opalescent nudibranch,"Answer: B
Explanation: Look at the picture of the flamboyant cuttlefish.
The flamboyant cuttlefish has skin that is adapted to ward off predators. It is poisonous and poisonous animals often have bright colors. The bright colors of the flamboyant cuttlefish serve as a warning sign that it is poisonous.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The opalescent nudibranch has skin that is adapted to ward off predators.
Opalescent nudibranchs are poisonous and poisonous animals often have bright colors. The bright colors of the opalescent nudibranch serve as a warning sign that it is poisonous.
The lichen katydid does not have a adaptation for warding off predators. It has camouflage instead. The lichen katydid is camouflaged as lichen. Camouflage is when an animal's appearance helps it fit in with its environment.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's body is one example of an adaptation. Animals that live in different ways can have adaptations that allow them to survive in similar ways. For example, bird wings and fish fins are adaptations for moving by air and water. This is because birds and fish have lived in water since before there were land animals.","Look at the picture of the flamboyant cuttlefish.

Why does Papua New Guinea share its island with another country?
Papua New Guinea takes up the eastern half of the island of New Guinea. The western half is part of Indonesia, an Asian country.
Beginning in the 17 th century, several countries took control of different parts of the island of New Guinea. By 1922, Australia controlled the entire eastern half of the island, and the Netherlands controlled the western half. In 1963, control over the western half was transferred to Indonesia, which had just gained independence from the Netherlands. Many people in western New Guinea did not want to become part of Indonesia, though, and some people in this area are still fighting to leave Indonesia today. The eastern part gained independence from Australia in 1975 and became Papua New Guinea.",2.361233762779016e-10,2.361233762779016e-10,0.14814814677640606,0.08333333333333333

Which of the following statements is supported by the passage?,"Scientists can study air masses to predict weather events.
Meteorologists are scientists who study meteors.",0,0,Scientists can study air masses to predict weather events.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A meteorologist uses atmospheric maps to examine air masses. This information helps the meteorologist predict weather events.

Read the text carefully.
A meteorologist uses atmospheric maps to examine air masses, which are large areas of air in Earth's lower atmosphere. The meteorologist notices that an air mass with dry air is approaching an air mass with warm, moist air. In the same region, there are strong winds higher in the atmosphere. The meteorologist recognizes that this combination of air masses and winds in the region could lead to a tornado event.
Now, study the diagram.
The image shows a tornado.
People can use what they know about objects and their parts to build models of weather events, such as tornadoes.
People can use models to test ideas about things they cannot observe directly. For example, a meteorologist built a model to test the effect of air masses and winds on weather events.
Work with other students to build a model of a tornado. Describe the parts of your model. Then, show how the parts fit together.","A meteorologist uses atmospheric maps to examine air masses. This information helps the meteorologist predict weather events.

Will these magnets attract or repel each other?,"attract
repel",0,0,attract,"Answer: A
Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. These poles attract. So, the magnets will attract each other.

Magnetic forces get weaker as the distance between magnets increases. Imagine having the same magnets as in the example, but much farther apart. In this case, the magnets would repel each other.","Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.

A rubber balloon is a solid because, although the balloon can change its shape, it has a definite size and shape.","A rubber balloon is a solid. You can bend a balloon. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Which animal's skin is better adapted as a warning sign to ward off predators?,"lionfish
impala",0,0,lionfish,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the picture of the golden dart frog.
The golden dart frog has poisonous glands in its brightly colored skin. The bright color serves as a warning sign that the animal is poisonous.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal's skin is better adapted.
The lionfish has brightly colored spines. Its spines are adapted to warn predators that the lionfish is poisonous.
The impala has dull-colored fur. Its fur is not adapted to warn predators. The impala uses its speed and agility to escape from predators.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's skin is one example of an adaptation. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, desert animals might have splotched colors to blend in with their environment. Forest animals might have camouflaged patterns with shades and shapes of the forest floor. Animals that live in areas with very cold weather might have thick fur to keep them warm.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",4.785117392129009e-06,4.785117392129009e-06,0.3140495841294994,0.18181818181818182

Explanation: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer is one variable. This variable is called the independent variable because you change it. The number of tomatoes that grow is the other variable in the experiment. This variable is called the dependent variable because its values depend on the independent variable.
Different experiments have different variables. The independent and dependent variables are what the experiment is about. Other variables that are measured are called controlled variables.

Controlled variables are kept the same in an experiment.
When you do an experiment, you must ensure that only one thing is changing. Changing only one thing makes it clear which variable is affecting the dependent variable.
In this experiment, the number of tomatoes is the dependent variable. This is the variable that is measured to see the effect of changing the number of fertilizers.
The amount of fertilizer is the independent variable. This is the variable that is changed to affect the dependent variable.","Experiments have variables, or parts that change.

Which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles?,"neither; their concentrations are the same
Solution A
Solution B",1,1,Solution A,"Answer: B
Explanation: The solvent volume for both solutions is the same. However, Solution A has more solute than Solution B. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent","The solvent volume for both solutions is the same. However, Solution A has more solute than Solution B. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

Explanation: Look at the information given and the picture of the experiment.
Stanley divided 40  evenly among eight paper bags and sealed the bags. He poked 20 small holes in four of the bags and left the other four without holes. He kept the bags at room temperature for three days. Then, Stanley opened the bags and counted the number of brown spots on each banana. He compared the average number of brown spots on bananas from bags with holes to the average number of brown spots on bananas from bags without holes.
The experiment was designed to compare how the number of brown spots on bananas is influenced by whether bags have holes. So, the question that this experiment can answer is 'Do bananas develop more brown spots if they are kept in bags with holes compared to bags without holes?'
The other question cannot be answered by the experiment. Looking at the results of this experiment will not tell Stanley whether development of brown spots is influenced by temperature or whether it is influenced by whether the bananas are unpeeled.

Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer?

First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.34685529657760095,0.2016416973823446,0.4285714235901708,0.29545454545454547
Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.

The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.",0,1,The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.,"B; Both Pair 1 and Pair 2 have the same magnet sizes and distances between magnets. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.","; Both Pair 1 and Pair 2 have the same magnet sizes and distances between magnets. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.","The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.",0.0019659068987353877,0.0009610340804143803,0.33663365984903443,0.21428571428571427

So, the bilberry contains matter that was once part of the bear sedge.","Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.
The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. No arrow points to the lichen. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the barren-ground caribou.
No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the bilberry.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

"Complete the text to describe the diagram.
Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the right than to the left
to the left than to the right",1,0,to the right than to the left,"Answer: A
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration until they are evenly distributed.
Sometimes, the solute particles in a solution move faster or slower without changing direction. When this happens, diffusion continues at the same rate. Other times, changes in concentration cause solute particles to move at different rates in different directions. This changes the rate of diffusion.
The rate of diffusion can be affected by changes in temperature, movement of the solution, and the shape of the container holding the solution. Like the solute particles, solvent particles are always moving. When the particles of a solvent move, it can cause solute particles to move. Diffusion occurs more quickly at warmer temperatures. When solute particles move faster, diffusion also occurs more quickly. Movement of the solution can increase the rate of diffusion by mixing solute particles into the solution. A change in the shape of the container does not affect the rate of diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of solute particles from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

A change in the shape of the container does not affect the rate of diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of solute particles from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.5074626865671642,0.17910606461516082,0.4489795868734694,0.45454545454545453

ertestanswer","The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.

The prime meridian does not pass through any part of North America or South America.",The picture shows that the prime meridian intersects the continent of Africa. The prime meridian goes all the way around the world. It passes through Great Britain and most of Africa. The prime meridian does not pass through any part of North America or South America.,"The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect North America or South America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",0.005643432001384189,0.0023622697312948087,0.28571428206003735,0.20454545454545456

neither; their concentrations are the same",1,1,Solution A,"B. Solution A
Explanation: The more concentrated a solution is, the higher its concentration of particles is. In a less concentrated solution, there are fewer particles of solute per solvent particle.
The number of blue particles represents the number of solute particles in each solution. Solution A has more solute particles than Solution B.
The solvent volume for each solution is the same. Therefore, Solution A, with its higher number of solute particles, is more concentrated than Solution B.","Solution A
Explanation: The more concentrated a solution is, the higher its concentration of particles is. In a less concentrated solution, there are fewer particles of solute per solvent particle.
The number of blue particles represents the number of solute particles in each solution. Solution A has more solute particles than Solution B.
The solvent volume for each solution is the same. Therefore, Solution A, with its higher number of solute particles, is more concentrated than Solution B.","In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.16482005012223733,0.04023903757449112,0.3770491758653588,0.3

Identify the question that Logan's experiment can best answer.,"Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume?
Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?",1,1,Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?,"Answer: B
Explanation: Look at the image and reread the question carefully.
Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?
The image shows a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails. The nail in the water has not rusted at all, but the nail in the vinegar has started to rust. This matches what Logan observed in his experiment.
The other option asks whether steel nails rust faster when submerged in a larger volume of liquid. However, the nails were submerged in the same volume of different liquids. So, it would not be fair to compare nails that rusted in different volumes of liquid.","Look at the image and reread the question carefully.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Select the organism in the same species as the blue jay.,"Cyanocitta cristata
Larus michahellis
Goura victoria",0,0,Cyanocitta cristata,"Answer: A
Explanation: A blue jay is an organism. Its scientific name is Cyanocitta cristata.
An organism's scientific name may refer to more than one organism. Organisms that belong to the same species may look alike. They may also act alike and come from the same area. Organisms in the same species are able to breed and have young.
But not all organisms that look alike, act alike, or come from the same area are in the same species. Organisms in the same species have exactly the same scientific name.
For example, this snake's scientific name is Chilabothrus imbricatus. The snake shown here is the only organism with this scientific name. So, this snake is in the species Chilabothrus imbricatus.
This snake's scientific name is Elaphe dione. Snakes with this name include many different types of snakes. So, not all snakes named Elaphe dione are in the same species.
Look at the picture of organisms below.
The snake on the left has the scientific name Elaphe dione. The snake on the right has the scientific name Elaphe dione. But these snakes are not in the same species. The snake on the left is in the species Natrix natrix.","A blue jay is an organism. Its scientific name is Cyanocitta cristata.

Larus michahellis does not have the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Larus michahellis are not in the same species.
Goura victoria does not have the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, Cyanocitta cristata and Goura victoria are not in the same species.
Cyanocitta cristata has the same scientific name as a blue jay. So, these organisms are in the same species.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.39775945654420874,0.10776401360483591,0.3999999950001837,0.16666666666666666

"Based on the Venn diagram, which statement is true of Leonardo da Vinci?","He was from Florence.
He created David.",0,0,He was from Florence.,"Answer: A
Explanation: This Venn diagram compares two famous Renaissance artists. The overlapping areas contain information about artists in both categories. Both Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were from Florence. Only Michelangelo created David. While both artists lived from the late 15th to early 16th century, this is not stated in the Venn diagram. Only Leonardo da Vinci is known for his scientific work.

A Venn diagram uses overlapping circles to display relationships between different things. Things that are the same about the things being compared go in the parts of the circles that overlap. Things that are different go in the parts of the circles that do not overlap.
So, in a Venn diagram:
The overlapping parts contain information about things that are the same.
The non-overlapping parts contain information about things that are different.
Both Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were from Florence. This means that the part where the circles overlap shows information about both artists. So, both artists were from the same city. The city does not need to be named in order to know that it is the information in the overlapping part of the diagram.
Only Michelangelo created David. This means that the part of the circle for Michelangelo, but not the part where the circles overlap, shows information about only Michelangelo. In other words, Michelangelo created David, but Leonardo da Vinci did not.","This Venn diagram compares two famous Renaissance artists.

Which of the following could Jennifer and Scarlett's test show?,"if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry",0,0,if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use,"Answer: A
Explanation: People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The results of tests can show whether a problem has been solved sufficiently or how close a solution is to working.
When a potential solution is tested, measurements are often used. Experiments can also be designed to find information by varying one piece at a time.
The results of tests are used to evaluate a problem's solutions. In some cases, the results show that the solution does not work. In other cases, the results indicate improvements that could be made. Sometimes, the results are even better than what was predicted!
There is often more than one solution to a problem. Some solutions may work better than others, however. By testing different designs, engineers can decide which solutions to recommend. Engineers share their test results. These results help other people decide which solutions to support.","People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.2867987135238418,0.10007505625235842,0.33507852903812946,0.2558139534883721

A coffee mug is a solid because the molecules that make up the coffee mug are close together and do not move around freely.","a solid

A coffee mug is a solid because the molecules that make up the coffee mug are close together and do not move around freely.","A coffee mug is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
When you pour coffee into a coffee mug, the mug keeps its shape. If you drop a coffee mug, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",4.531799920768572e-05,1.40854232331323e-05,0.17777777515061732,0.06818181818181818

The number of pink particles in each solution is the same. However, Solution A has a greater volume of solvent than Solution B. Therefore, the concentration of pink particles in Solution A is lower than in Solution B.","Solution A

The number of pink particles in each solution is the same. However, Solution A has a greater volume of solvent than Solution B. Therefore, the concentration of pink particles in Solution A is lower than in Solution B.","In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.

The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",1,1,The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.,"B

Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. The magnitude of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets. The closer the magnets are to each other, the greater the magnetic force.
In Pair 1 and Pair 2, the magnets attract. The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.","Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together.

Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.","The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

What is the direction of this pull?,"away from the first train car
toward the first train car",1,1,toward the first train car,"Answer: B
Explanation: The magnet in the first train car pulls the magnet in the second train car. This pulls the second train car along behind the first train car.

Magnets can pull or push other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, or pull together, we say they are exerting an attractive force on each other. When magnets repel, or push apart, we say they are exerting a repulsive force on each other.
The strength of a force is the power a force has to move an object. The更强 the attractive or repulsive force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
Distance affects the force that magnets exert. As magnets move closer to each other, the force between them变得更强. As magnets move farther apart, the force between them变得更弱.","The magnet in the first train car pulls the magnet in the second train car.

Explanation: An adult orange tree makes seeds in its flowers. The flowers make up the blossom of the orange tree.

Every plant makes seeds in its flowers. Flowers are part of a flower structure. A flower structure makes seeds and fruits. Plants use their seeds and fruits to help them reproduce.","An adult orange tree makes seeds in its flowers. The flowers make up the blossom of the orange tree.

Every plant makes seeds in its flowers. Flowers are part of a flower structure. A flower structure makes seeds and fruits. Plants use their seeds and fruits to help them reproduce.","Flowers make seeds. After a flower is pollinated, male cells from the pollen combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The fruit can grow around the seeds. But the fruit does not make seeds. Both the fruit and the seeds grow from parts of the flower.

Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",0.044712571839286175,0.0021019572892695365,0.299065416294873,0.23333333333333334
Look at the models of molecules below. Select the elementary substance.,"carbon tetrachloride

Explanation: There are three different types of molecules in the image. Each type of molecule is a different elementary substance.

A molecule is composed of two or more atoms that are covalently bonded together. An elementary substance consists of two or more of the same type of atoms covalently bonded together. Therefore, a molecule of the elementary substance is made up of two or more of the same type of atoms. A substance that is composed of molecules is an elementary substance if all the molecules in the substance are the same.
There are three nitrogen molecules. Each nitrogen molecule is made up of two nitrogen atoms.
The fluoromethanol and carbon tetrachloride molecules are not made up of the same type of atom, so they are not molecules of an elementary substance.","There are three different types of molecules in the image. Each type of molecule is a different elementary substance.

Explanation: A great gray owl is an Strix nebulosa. It is the same species as this organism.

An organism's species is one type of taxon. Taxons are groups of organisms that contain similar traits. Organisms in the same taxon share similar traits.
Scientists use binomial nomenclature to name organisms. Binomial nomenclature gives each organism a two-part name. The first part identifies the organism's genus. The second part identifies the organism's species within the genus. For example, one species of dog is the domestic dog, Canis familiaris. The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis and the species familiaris.
Either part of a species name can contain capital letters. However, the designation of the species must include a space and a period between the two parts.
So, the species name Canis familiaris has two parts. ""Canis"" is the first part, and ""familiaris"" is the second part.","A great gray owl is an Strix nebulosa. It is the same species as this organism.

Which animal's skin is better adapted as a warning sign to ward off predators?,"crown-of-thorns sea star
peppered moth",0,0,crown-of-thorns sea star,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows a Spanish shawl nudibranch. It has stinging cells in its brightly colored skin. The bright colors serve as a warning sign that the animal is toxic and dangerous. The Spanish shawl nudibranch's skin is adapted to ward off predators.
The crown-of-thorns sea star and the peppered moth are both insects. They have exoskeletons, which are strong outer layers that protect these animals's structures. Insects' exoskeletons do not change as the insects grow. So, these animals must shed their exoskeletons as they grow larger. This process is called molting.

Animals in similar environments often develop similar adaptations. Compare the adaptations of the crown-of-thorns sea star and the peppered moth. Both animals have coloration that is well-matched to their surroundings. The crown-of-thorns sea star has this coloration as a warning sign. The peppered moth has this coloration to help it blend in with its environment.

Warning signs are a type of adaptation. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's body is a type of adaptation. An animal's shape can help it move, hunt, escape predators, or keep its body temperature constant.
Different animals living in the same environment can develop similar adaptations. For example, birds and rabbits living in hot deserts are both adapted to keep cool. The bird has light-colored feathers, which reflect, or bounce away, light. The rabbit has white fur, which allows it to blend into the environment.","The image shows a Spanish shawl nudibranch.

Both animals have coloration that is well-matched to their surroundings. The crown-of-thorns sea star has this coloration as a warning sign. The peppered moth has this coloration to help it blend in with its environment.

Warning signs are a type of adaptation. An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's body is a type of adaptation. An animal's shape can help it move, hunt, escape predators, or keep its body temperature constant.
Different animals living in the same environment can develop similar adaptations. For example, birds and rabbits living in hot deserts are both adapted to keep cool. The bird has light-colored feathers, which reflect, or bounce away, light. The rabbit has white fur, which allows it to blend into the environment.","Look at the picture of the Spanish shawl nudibranch.
The Spanish shawl nudibranch has stinging cells in its brightly colored skin. Its skin is adapted to ward off predators. The bright colors serve as a warning sign that the Spanish shawl nudibranch is toxic and dangerous.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
sample A
neither; the samples have the same temperature",0,0,sample B,"Answer: A
Explanation: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have greater kinetic energy on average than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the greater average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

An object's temperature is related to the average of the objects' kinetic energies. The higher the object's temperature, the higher the average of the objects' kinetic energies.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined not only by its mass but also by its speed. The larger the particle's mass or the higher the particle's speed, the greater its kinetic energy.

Is shampoo a mineral?,"yes
no",1,1,no,"Answer: B
Explanation: Shampoo is a mixture. It is a human-made mixture. It has two forms, a liquid and a gel. Shampoo is not a mineral because it is made of different substances mixed together.

A mixture is a substance in which parts remain separate. The parts in a mixture can be mixed in different ways. Mixtures do not have a fixed shape or fixed volume.
A element is a substance that cannot be turned into other substances by chemical changes. Hydrogen and oxygen are elements. Every element is a type of matter. Matters are substances that take up space by having mass and volume.
The elements that make up a mixture are mixed in a fixed ratio. You cannot change the ratio of the elements in a mixture by changing how the mixture is made.
Hematite and magnetite are elements. Either element can be mixed in any amount with any other element. For example, you can have a mixture with lots of hematite and a little magnetite, or a mixture with lots of magnetite and a little hematite.","Shampoo is a mixture. It is a human-made mixture.

So, shampoo is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.

It has soil that is poor in nutrients. It also has other water ecosystems nearby.",0,1,It has soil that is poor in nutrients. It also has other water ecosystems nearby.,"Answer: B
Explanation: A habitat's physical features can affect which species live there. They can also affect which types of biotic factors are present.
There are two main types of physical features: climate and soil. The physical features of a habitat affect the organisms that live there by determining which biotic factors are present.
Which factor is a physical feature? Both soil and climate are physical features. Climate is a long-term weather pattern in a place. It can be described by temperatures and amount of rain or snow.
Soil is made up of bits of rock and organic matter. It is a physical feature because it has a big effect on which organisms can live in a place.
A biotic factor is any living part of an ecosystem. Biotic factors can be organisms or part of an organism. For example, a rabbit is a biotic factor in a forest where rabbits live. Rabbit waste is also a biotic factor in this forest ecosystem. It provides nutrition to plants and other organisms.
Soil and other physical features affect whether an area has biotic factors like plants and animals.","A habitat's physical features can affect which species live there. They can also affect which types of biotic factors are present.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A
sample B",2,2,sample B,"Answer: C
Explanation: The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy. Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

An object's temperature depends on the average kinetic energy of its particles. Use the relationship between kinetic energy and temperature to find the temperature of each sample.","The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance.

Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the left than to the right
to the right than to the left",0,1,to the right than to the left,"Answer: B
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration until they are evenly distributed.
Sometimes, the solute particles in a solution move faster and faster during diffusion until they reach equilibrium. Equilibrium is when the number of solute particles is the same on both sides of the membrane.
The rate of diffusion is affected by several factors. For example, if the solvent is hotter, the solute particles will move faster and the rate of diffusion will increase. If there is a greater concentration of solute particles on one side of the membrane, then the rate of diffusion will increase.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

The rate of diffusion is affected by several factors. For example, if the solvent is hotter, the solute particles will move faster and the rate of diffusion will increase. If there is a greater concentration of solute particles on one side of the membrane, then the rate of diffusion will increase.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 5 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.5027732629405077,0.2028906752806001,0.5132743312835775,0.47058823529411764

Which animal is also adapted to use its neck to appear large and scary to a predator?,"bearded dragon
green anole",0,2,N/A,"Answer: C
Explanation: Look at the picture of the spectacled cobra.
The spectacled cobra has a long neck. It is adapted to use its neck to appear large and scary to a predator. When it does this, its predator may think the spectacled cobra is bigger than it really is. This may allow the spectacled cobra to escape.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The bearded dragon has a short neck. It is not adapted to use its neck to appear large and scary to a predator.
The green anole has a long neck. It is adapted to use its neck to appear large and scary to a predator.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's nose is one example of an adaptation. Animals' noses can be adapted in different ways. For example, a broad nose might help a animal breathe better in cold weather. A wide nose gives more space for blood vessels. Air loses heat slowly when it passes through a wide nose.
Animals' behaviors can also be adaptations. For example, some animals camouflage themselves. This means their color and pattern help them hide from predators. This adaptation can help the animals avoid predation.","Look at the picture of the spectacled cobra.

Europe",1,1,Africa,"B

Explanation: The equator passes through the middle of Africa. It does not pass through the middle of North America or Europe.",The equator passes through the middle of Africa. It does not pass through the middle of North America or Europe.,"The equator is the line at 0° latitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Europe or North America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",3.018273364266869e-06,8.527051250810637e-07,0.18644067562194772,0.06818181818181818

Is peridotite a mineral?,"no
yes",0,0,no,"Answer: A
Explanation: A mineral has these properties: solid, not a pure substance, naturally occurring, no fixed crystal structure, not made by living things. Peridotite is not a mineral because it is a mixture.

A rock is one or more minerals or glass that are combined in a particular way. Volcanic rocks, sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic rocks are types of rocks.
Minerals and rocks both have properties. A property is a characteristic of the substance. Minerals and rocks can be identified by their properties.","A mineral has these properties: solid, not a pure substance, naturally occurring, no fixed crystal structure, not made by living things.

Minerals and rocks both have properties. A property is a characteristic of the substance. Minerals and rocks can be identified by their properties.","Peridotite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, peridotite is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.11948690842478199,0.010242562219910704,0.4052287534948098,0.2

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample A",0,0,sample B,"Answer: A
Explanation: The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The average kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.
Each particle in the two samples has the same speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

An object's temperature tells you how hot or cold it is. Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the object. Objects with higher temperatures have particles with higher speeds, and therefore, higher kinetic energies, on average.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

The Asian golden weaver has a short, thick beak. Its beak is adapted to crack hard seeds.
The common swift has a long, thin beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack hard seeds. The common swift uses its beak to catch insects in the air.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird crack hard seeds. Birds that have adapted shapes of beaks that are suited for their diets tend to survive and reproduce better than birds with shapes of beaks that are not well suited for their diets.","Look at the picture of the hawfinch.

Which trait do African wild dogs have?,"They live in packs with thousands of other African wild dogs.
They have four legs.",1,1,They have four legs.,"Answer: B
Explanation: An African wild dog has four legs. It has this trait because most animals have four legs.

But African wild dogs do not have the trait of living in packs with thousands of other African wild dogs. Most African wild dogs live in packs with only 3 to 20 other African wild dogs.

"Complete the text to describe the diagram.
Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the left than to the right
to the right than to the left",0,1,to the right than to the left,"Answer: B
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration until they are evenly distributed.
Sometimes, the solute particles in a solution move faster and move farther during diffusion. The rate of diffusion is affected by several factors. The rate of diffusion increases when:
- the concentration of the solute is higher.
- the size of the solute particles is smaller.
- the temperature is higher.
During diffusion, solute particles move from where they are at a higher concentration to where they are at a lower concentration. Eventually, the particles will be evenly distributed and reach equilibrium.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

- the size of the solute particles is smaller.
- the temperature is higher.
During diffusion, solute particles move from where they are at a higher concentration to where they are at a lower concentration. Eventually, the particles will be evenly distributed and reach equilibrium.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.4846128998526177,0.18691948138878356,0.47963800405479007,0.4411764705882353

Explanation: Scientists use binomial nomenclature, or two-name naming systems, to name organisms. First, they identify the genus, or group of organisms that share many traits. Then, they identify the species, or group of organisms within a genus that are most similar to each other. The genus always comes first in binomial nomenclature.
For any organism, you can use a website to perform a scientific search using the name of the organism. The search results should include the genus of the organism.
Look at the name of the green tree frog. The genus is Hyla.

Strix aluco has the same genus as the green tree frog.
These birds are owls. Their genus is Strix.
The organism in genus Hyla is the green tree frog. Its scientific name is Hyla cinerea. The other organisms are in different genera. So, they are not in the same genus as the green tree frog.","Scientists use binomial nomenclature, or two-name naming systems, to name organisms.

This organism and the green tree frog are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Hyla cinerea.
Ardea cinerea and Hyla cinerea are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ardea cinerea and Hyla cinerea have the same species name within their genus, cinerea. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ardea cinerea is in the genus Ardea, and Hyla cinerea is in the genus Hyla.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Hyla cinerea are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.320293906578097,0.0861839494245492,0.5088757346535486,0.5

First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

What evidence of a flood does this picture show?,"The benches on the riverbank are partly underwater.
There are two benches beside the river.",0,0,The benches on the riverbank are partly underwater.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A flood is when water covers areas of land that are usually not under water. The benches on the riverbank are partly underwater. This is evidence of a flood.

A river is a natural flow of fresh water. Most rivers flow into a larger body of water, like an ocean or a lake.
Rivers begin in high places, like mountains or hills. In a mountainous area, many small streams start. These streams flow down the mountain. They get bigger as they get more water from other streams. This bigger stream is called a river.
A river flows toward a lower place. This is because water flows from higher places to lower places. The river keeps getting bigger as it picks up other streams. It flows through plains and valleys. It may go around mountains. A river ends when it reaches a low place, like a lake. Or, a river may end where it flows into an ocean.","A flood is when water covers areas of land that are usually not under water. The benches on the riverbank are partly underwater.

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.20520065744525054,0.009825193025293208,0.18749999500217027,0.047619047619047616

"Are the bubbles in soda a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a gas
a solid
a liquid",0,0,a gas,"Answer: A
Explanation: The bubbles in soda are a gas. Gas is all around us. Air is a gas. We can't see it, but we can feel it when it blows our hair out of our face.

A solid has a size and shape of its own. A liquid can change its shape. It can take the shape of its container. A gas takes the shapes and size of its container.
Water exists as solids, liquids, and gases. Think about ice cubes in a glass of water. The ice cube is a solid. It has a size and shape of its own. The water is a liquid. It takes the shape of the glass. The steam is a gas. It takes the shape of the room.
Whether water exists as a solid, liquid, or gas depends on the temperature. Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is.
There is a relationship between temperature and the states of matter. The temperature of a substance can cause changes in its state.","The bubbles in soda are a gas. Gas is all around us. Air is a gas. We can't see it, but we can feel it when it blows our hair out of our face.

There is a relationship between temperature and the states of matter. The temperature of a substance can cause changes in its state.","The bubbles in soda are filled with carbon dioxide gas. Carbon dioxide gas spreads out to fill a space.
Carbon dioxide fills all the space inside the bubbles. If the bubbles pop at the surface of the soda, the carbon dioxide will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",0.30093845077196973,0.09758180781996643,0.32038834472240557,0.2

Select the chemical formula for this molecule.,"He2O2
HO3
H2O2
CH2O2",2,2,H2O2,"Answer: C
Explanation: A molecule of this substance contains two oxygen atoms and two hydrogen atoms. Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom form one water molecule with the formula H2O. Since there are two water molecules, the formula for this substance is H2O2.

Every substance has a unique chemical formula. The numbers in a chemical formula tell you how many atoms of each element are in one molecule of the substance.
For example, each molecule of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, contains two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms.
The letters in a chemical formula tell you what elements are in the substance. Every chemical formula is based on an element's symbol, which is a short way of writing the name of an element.
You can find the symbol for an element on the periodic table of elements, which shows the symbol for each element.","A molecule of this substance contains two oxygen atoms and two hydrogen atoms.

You can find the symbol for an element on the periodic table of elements, which shows the symbol for each element.","H is the symbol for hydrogen. O is the symbol for oxygen. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and O. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There are two oxygen atoms, so O will have a subscript of 2.
The correct formula is H2 O2.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.1267849718241221,0.031348697477042095,0.3781094483255365,0.21311475409836064

Which better describes the Masoala National Park ecosystem?,"It has year-round rain. It also has many different types of organisms.
It has cold winters. It also has many different types of organisms.",0,0,It has year-round rain. It also has many different types of organisms.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A tropical rain forest is a type of ecosystem. Tropical rain forests get more than 200 cm of rain each year. The plants and animals that live in an ecosystem help each other in a complex web of energy flow and matter movement. Each ecosystem has its own unique characteristics, or physical features. Ecology is the study of the relationships between living things and their environment. An ecosystem's ecology includes the physical properties, such as temperature and rain, and the organisms who live there.
Mazoala National Park is a tropical rain forest. It has year-round rain. It also has many different types of organisms.

All organisms in an ecosystem are connected by food webs. A food web shows how food and energy move through an ecosystem. Food webs include producers, consumers, and decomposers.
Producers make their own food using carbon dioxide and water. Most producers in tropical rain forest ecosystems are green plants. These plants make their own food through photosynthesis.
Consumers get their food by eating other organisms. Primary consumers eat producers. Secondary consumers eat primary consumers. Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. Some consumers are tertiary consumers themselves. These consumers have four or more steps in their food chain.
Decomposers break down dead organic material. Without decomposers, dead organisms would堆积未处理的有机物质. Decomposers help cycle the matter in dead organisms back into the ecosystem. Most decomposers are decomposer organisms, such as fungi and bacteria. Some animals are also decomposers.
The physical properties of an ecosystem affect the organisms that live there. The amount of rainfall in an ecosystem can affect which types of producers grow there. These producers can then be eaten by consumers. So, the amount of rainfall can affect the types of consumers and decomposers that an ecosystem has.","A tropical rain forest is a type of ecosystem.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.
Examples of questions that this experiment can answer include:
Does soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?
Do daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?
Are daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",0.26722242257363643,0.014274296570908465,0.21739129934782622,0.06818181818181818
"Is the air moving through a trombone a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a gas
a solid
a liquid",0,0,a gas,"Answer: A
Explanation: The air is moving through a trombone. Air is a gas.

Gases can be compressed into smaller volumes. They can also be expanded to larger volumes.","The air is moving through a trombone. Air is a gas.

Gases can be compressed into smaller volumes. They can also be expanded to larger volumes.","The air moving through a trombone is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air in a trombone expands to fill all the space inside the trombone. When air leaves the trombone, the air expands to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",6.783081207320033e-05,8.96943084879128e-06,0.22058823268274222,0.10869565217391304

The Eurasian lynx has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The aardvark has a long tube-shaped mouth and a few, small teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The aardvark uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths.",0.23670697830610515,0.16540610478138465,0.5093167653963968,0.391304347826087

Explanation: The image shows the Sahara Desert.
The Sahara Desert covers a large part of northern Africa. It does not get much rainfall each year. In other words, the climate of the Sahara Desert is hot and dry. This is an example of climate.

A climate description tells you about the typical weather in a place. Climate descriptions are based on long-term observations. This information can help you understand your local climate.
Climate is what the atmosphere is like on average. Climate describes typical temperatures and amounts of precipitation over a place's land area and over a long period of time. For example, the temperature in one day in July might rise to 40°C. The climate description for that place's climate might say that the average temperature in July is usually around 32°C.
There are different ways to describe climate. Three common ways to describe a place's climate are:
1. The typical temperature range is hot and mild.
2. The amount of precipitation typically decreases from east to west.
3. The climate is humid for most of the year.","The image shows the Sahara Desert.

Which better describes the Buffalo Gap National Grassland ecosystem?,"It has hot summers. It also has soil that is rich in nutrients.
It has cool winters. It also has cool summers.",0,0,It has hot summers. It also has soil that is rich in nutrients.,"Answer: A
Explanation: There are three main types of temperate grasslands: steppe, pampas, and prairie. These terms are often used interchangeably. But there are small differences between them.
Pampas grasslands are in South America. They have long, thin leaves. Pampas grasslands get lots of rain during the summer. But the winter can be very dry.
Steppe and prairie grasslands are in North America and Europe. But they have different amounts of rain. The prairie is in the Great Plains of North America. It has short, stiff leaves. The steppe is to the east of the prairie. It gets even less rain. The steppe has even shorter, thinner leaves than the prairie.
So, Buffalo Gap National Grassland has hot summers. It also has soil that is rich in nutrients.

A grassland is a type of ecosystem. Grasslands are found on all continents except Antarctica. Different kinds of grasslands are in different places. For example, some get lots of rain. Others get only a little rain each year.
These factors help determine which kind of grasses grow in a region. They also help determine whether other species, such as flowers, herbs, and shrubs, can grow there.
No two grasslands are exactly alike. But all grasslands have one important thing in common. All have large areas with growing grasses.","There are three main types of temperate grasslands: steppe, pampas, and prairie. These terms are often used interchangeably.

CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein",1,1,CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein,"Answer: B
Explanation: Genes are parts of cells that contain information used to make proteins. Genes are often compared to instructions in a recipe. Just as a recipe contains steps for making a specific food, a gene contains information used to make a specific protein.
The structure of a protein is closely related to its function. If the structure of a protein changes, the function of the protein may also change. Changes in proteins can affect organisms. For example, a protein that does not function correctly may cause a health problem.
Different versions of a gene are called alleles. People who have certain alleles for a gene may have a hard time making the normal protein. These people may have a health problem related to the function of the protein.
Different alleles of a gene can cause different traits in organisms. However, some genes have the same alleles in all people. For example, all people have the same alleles for the gene that has information used to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that normally carries oxygen.

The figure shows the muscles in the human body. The mutation in the CLCN1 gene affected the structure and function of the chloride channel protein.

An organism's genes affect its traits. Sometimes, a mutation in a gene can change an allele. This new allele can lead to a new form of the encoded protein. Sometimes, this can affect the trait produced by the trait.","Genes are parts of cells that contain information used to make proteins. Genes are often compared to instructions in a recipe.

Select the organism in the same genus as the North American beaver.,"Castor canadensis
Ovis canadensis
Strix varia",0,0,Castor canadensis,"Answer: A
Explanation: A North American beaver's scientific name is Castor canadensis.
Ovis canadensis does not match the format of the North American beaver's scientific name.
Strix varia does not match the format of the North American beaver's scientific name.

When we write how organisms are related using binomial nomenclature, we use the same genus for organisms that are closely related. We usually write the genus for closely related organisms that are from different species in the same order. The closer two organisms are related, the more likely they are to be in the same genus. The North American beaver is in the genus Castor. Castor canadensis is also in the genus Castor. Therefore, these organisms are in the same genus.
Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus. They are in different genera.
Strix varia and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus. They are in different genera.","A North American beaver's scientific name is Castor canadensis.

Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus. They are in different genera.
Strix varia and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus. They are in different genera.","A North American beaver's scientific name is Castor canadensis. The first word of its scientific name is Castor.
This organism and the North American beaver are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Castor canadensis.
Strix varia is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix varia and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus.
Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ovis canadensis and Castor canadensis have the same species name within their genus, canadensis. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ovis canadensis is in the genus Ovis, and Castor canadensis is in the genus Castor.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.26833597542879545,0.1361200267950804,0.42758620212508924,0.3684210526315789
Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample B
sample A",2,2,sample A,"Answer: C
Explanation: The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy. Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

The figure shows two pure substances in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one particle in the substance.","The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance.

Select the chemical formula for this molecule.,"BF3

HB3F
B2F3",0,0,BF3,"Answer: A
Explanation: Use the symbol or number at each bond to help you count atoms. There is 1 boron atom, and 3 fluorine atoms, so the chemical formula is BF3.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms joined together in large structures. The full details of a joint can be complex, but you can often simplify a joint by representing it as a model:
- circles to represent atoms,
- lines to represent the joints between atoms.
A chemical formula shows the types and numbers of atoms that make up a molecule of a substance. Every chemical formula represents one substance that can be made from particular atoms in a particular way. For example, the formula for water is written H2O. This tells you that every sample of water is made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom joined together in a particular way.","Use the symbol or number at each bond to help you count atoms.

This tells you that every sample of water is made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom joined together in a particular way.","B is the symbol for boron. F is the symbol for fluorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one boron atom and three fluorine atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols B and F. There is one boron atom, so B will not have a subscript. There are three fluorine atoms, so F will have a subscript of 3.
The correct formula is BF3.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.1275843347302816,0.029188507580517536,0.4239631288751089,0.288135593220339

Will these magnets attract or repel each other?,"repel
attract",1,1,attract,"Answer: B
Explanation: The magnets will attract each other because the magnetic poles are different.

Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.

What type of rock is sandstone?,"igneous
metamorphic
sedimentary",2,2,sedimentary,"Answer: C
Explanation: Sandstone is a type of rock. Rocks are made of one or more minerals. Minerals are types of matter that have a fixed composition and specific properties.
Rocks formed from sediment are called sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks often contain layers. These layers form as sediments are deposited. Over time, the layers get compacted, or pressed together. This causes the rocks to form.
Sedimentary rocks have formed from sediment in three main ways:
1. Chemical precipitation: Water contains minerals dissolved in it. When water evaporates, the water loses heat. In some cases, this can cause the water to precipitate, or give off, a mineral.
2. Cementation: Cement is a type of mineral that can form when minerals precipitate. Cement can form between pieces of sediment. Over time, the cement can harden. This can cause the sediment to form into a rock.
3. Organic formation: Sometimes, the sediments in water include dead plants and animals. Over time, these can harden into rocks.

Now, let's look at each type of rock and how it forms:
Igneous rocks form when melted rock cools and hardens. Melted rock is also called magma. Magma can cool above or below the ground.
Metamorphic rocks form when sedimentary or igneous rocks change. This change can occur when sedimentary or igneous rocks are subject to high pressures and temperatures. These changes can cause the rock to change colors and form new minerals.
Sedimentary rocks form from sediment. The sediment can be deposited by water, ice, or wind. The sediment layers harden over time and form rock.
The picture shows sandstone, a sedimentary rock. Sandstone forms from sediment. The sediment can be deposited by water, ice, or wind. The sediment layers harden over time and form rock.","Sandstone is a type of rock. Rocks are made of one or more minerals.

1. Chemical precipitation: Water contains minerals dissolved in it. When water evaporates, the water loses heat. In some cases, this can cause the water to precipitate, or give off, a mineral.
2. Cementation: Cement is a type of mineral that can form when minerals precipitate. Cement can form between pieces of sediment. Over time, the cement can harden. This can cause the sediment to form into a rock.
3. Organic formation: Sometimes, the sediments in water include dead plants and animals. Over time, these can harden into rocks.

Now, let's look at each type of rock and how it forms:
Igneous rocks form when melted rock cools and hardens. Melted rock is also called magma. Magma can cool above or below the ground.
Metamorphic rocks form when sedimentary or igneous rocks change. This change can occur when sedimentary or igneous rocks are subject to high pressures and temperatures. These changes can cause the rock to change colors and form new minerals.
Sedimentary rocks form from sediment. The sediment can be deposited by water, ice, or wind. The sediment layers harden over time and form rock.
The picture shows sandstone, a sedimentary rock. Sandstone forms from sediment. The sediment can be deposited by water, ice, or wind. The sediment layers harden over time and form rock.","Sandstone is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Material that is eroded in nature is called sediment. Sand is a type of sediment. Over time, layers of sand can build up in places like deserts and beaches. The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Sandstone forms when the bottom layers of sand are pressed together to form rock.

Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.",0.3240418118466899,0.06385899285349865,0.41628958800597865,0.5
Is pyrite a mineral?,"no

Explanation: Pyrite is a mineral. It is a pure substance with a fixed crystal structure. It is also found in nature.

Minerals have fixed crystal structures. The same mineral always has the same appearance.","Pyrite is a mineral. It is a pure substance with a fixed crystal structure. It is also found in nature.

Minerals have fixed crystal structures. The same mineral always has the same appearance.","Pyrite has all the properties of a mineral. So, pyrite is a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.004486298549504349,0.001329011931044119,0.3193277278723254,0.20588235294117646

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Select the organism in the same species as the comet moth.,"Sphodromantis viridis
Argema mittrei
Acanthaster planci",1,1,Argema mittrei,"Answer: B
Explanation: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. No other organism shares the same scientific name.
Comet moths and Argema mittrei are in the same genus and the same species.
Comet moths and Sphodromantis viridis are in the same order but different genera.
Comet moths and Acanthaster planci are in different orders. They are not as closely related.

"Complete the text to describe the diagram.
Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the left than to the right
to the right than to the left",0,1,to the right than to the left,"Answer: B
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration until they are evenly distributed.
Sometimes, the solute particles in a solution move faster. In the saltwater solution, the sodium ions and chloride ions may move closer to the center of the solution. When this happens, we say that the concentration of sodium and chloride ions in that area of the solution is high.
Other times, the solute particles may move slower. In the saltwater solution, the sodium and chloride ions may move closer to the edge of the solution. When this happens, we say that the concentration of sodium and chloride ions in that area of the solution is low.
Over time, the solute particles will move around until the concentration is even on all sides. This is when the solution reaches equilibrium. Equilibrium is when solute particles are evenly distributed in a solution.
Remember that a solute can move in only one direction during diffusion. But solute particles can move in more than one direction toward equilibrium. Look at the diagram below and think about solute particles moving in different directions.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

Remember that a solute can move in only one direction during diffusion. But solute particles can move in more than one direction toward equilibrium. Look at the diagram below and think about solute particles moving in different directions.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.4955223880597015,0.19129673422924018,0.4979253062343969,0.48484848484848486

Explanation: A habitat's physical features can affect which organisms live there. Physical features of an ecosystem can include things like its water supply, temperatures, and elevation. This information can affect the distribution of organisms in an ecosystem.
There are two main types of ecosystems: water and land. Whether a ecosystem is water or land depends on the physical features of the ecosystem. For example, an ecosystem with lots of water, such as a pond, is a water ecosystem. A pond has enough water to cover most of the area. Many plants and animals that live in a pond cannot live outside of water for very long.

Earth's organisms rely on the atmosphere for which of the following?,"stable temperatures
sunlight",0,0,stable temperatures,"Answer: A
Explanation: Earth's organisms rely on the atmosphere for stable temperatures. The atmosphere helps keep stable temperatures on Earth. Without this layer of gases, Earth's temperature would be much higher or much lower than it is.
Living organisms take in and release certain gases in the atmosphere. They also help determine how heat travels through the atmosphere. This affects the overall temperature of Earth.
Gases in the atmosphere also help protect living organisms. Some gases in the atmosphere block harmful forms of sunlight. Without this protection, life on Earth would be hard to sustain.

The atmosphere surrounds Earth. Many living organisms depend on the atmosphere for stable temperatures. Without the atmosphere, there would be large differences between day and night temperatures. Some forms of sunlight would reach Earth and harm living organisms.","Earth's organisms rely on the atmosphere for stable temperatures. The atmosphere helps keep stable temperatures on Earth.

Which term matches the picture?,"Cenozoic era
Mesozoic era",1,1,Mesozoic era,"Answer: B
Explanation: The picture shows a dinosaur. Dinosaurs lived during the Mesozoic era, or Age of Reptiles.

Scientists divide the history of Earth into eras. Different types of animal life help distinguish these eras. We live in the Cenozoic era, which began roughly sixty-six million years ago. The Cenozoic era is known as the Age of Mammals because mammals, like humans, are the largest land animals. During the previous era, called the Mesozoic era, big reptiles, like dinosaurs, were the dominant animal species—it's nicknamed the Age of Reptiles. Some scientists believe that, at the end of the Mesozoic era, a large object from space collided with Earth, helping cause the mass extinction of the dinosaurs and ushering in the Age of Mammals.

Which better describes the tide pool ecosystems in Little Corona Beach?,"It has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is poor in nutrients.
It has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is rich in nutrients.",1,0,It has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is poor in nutrients.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A tide pool ecosystem has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is poor in nutrients.

The organisms in a place affect and are affected by the nonliving things in their environment. Environments can vary in the available resources and other factors that affect organisms. Organisms respond to their environments in different ways. This response affects the organisms' ability to survive and reproduce in their habitat.
There are different types of terrestrial, or land environment, habitats. Within these habitats, there are ranges of abiotic factors, such as amount and type of precipitation, temperature, and light availability. Organisms in different land environment habitats adapt to different ranges of abiotic factors. For example, temperature affects the growth of plants. As temperature changes, the type of plants found in an area may change.
Different land environment habitats can also have different types of soil or rock, different amounts of precipitation, and different levels of light availability. These differences affect the types of organisms that can live there.","A tide pool ecosystem has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is poor in nutrients.

Which fish's mouth is also adapted for tearing through meat?,"parrotfish
starry moray",1,2,N/A,"Answer: C
Explanation: Look at the picture of the sand tiger shark.
The sand tiger shark has a wide mouth that is adapted for tearing through meat. It eats turtles, dolphins, and other fish.
Now look at each label below the image. Choose the label that tells how the sand tiger shark's wide mouth is adapted.
Birds such as parrotfish have strong, flat beaks. The beak is adapted to tear through meat.
Mouths of starry morays have sharp teeth. The teeth are adapted to hold onto slippery fish.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp pointed beak might help a bird tear through meat. A short, thick beak might help a bird break out eggs from their shells.","Look at the picture of the sand tiger shark.

"Based on the arrows, which of the following living things is an omnivore?","kelp bass
zooplankton",0,0,kelp bass,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the arrows in the direction they point. These point to the kelp bass. The kelp bass is eaten by nothing in the food web. Therefore, the kelp bass is a top predator. Top predators are omnivores that eat both producers and other animals.

Every living thing needs matter to stay alive. Living things get matter by eating. This process is called consumption. Arrows in a food web show consumption. They point from a source of matter to an organism that consumes the matter.
The arrow points from phytoplankton to zooplankton. This shows that zooplankton consumes phytoplankton.
Zooplankton is consumed by both the plainfin midshipman and the bat star. Both of these organisms are consumers.
The plainfin midshipman also consumes phytoplankton. The bat star also consumes kelp. Both of these organisms are also consumers.","Look at the arrows in the direction they point.

Zooplankton is consumed by both the plainfin midshipman and the bat star. Both of these organisms are consumers.
The plainfin midshipman also consumes phytoplankton. The bat star also consumes kelp. Both of these organisms are also consumers.","Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The zooplankton has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the phytoplankton. So, the zooplankton is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer. The kelp bass also has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton and the plainfin midshipman, which are both consumers. The kelp bass eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.

A food web is a model.
Models can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.
A living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.
A living thing in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the living thing eats more than one other living thing in the food web.",0.16645830918629423,0.04142281151914695,0.5088757347221737,0.5263157894736842
Which statement is true about seeds?,"A plant's flowers make seeds.
A plant's fruit makes seeds.",0,1,A plant's fruit makes seeds.,"Answer: B
Explanation: A plant's flowers make seeds. After pollination, a flower becomes a fruit containing seeds.
Every fruit has a seed or seeds. Fruits are the parts of a flower that contain seeds. Some fruits, like apples, have one big seed. Other fruits, like a pinecone, have many small seeds.

Fruits are adapted to help with seed dispersal. This is the process by which fruits are released from a plant and moved to a new location. Fruit colors, smells, and textures can all help fruits be dispersed by animals.
Seeds can also be dispersed differently. For example, some seeds are dispersed by water. Other seeds are dispersed by the wind.","A plant's flowers make seeds. After pollination, a flower becomes a fruit containing seeds.

The fruit can grow around the seeds. But the fruit does not make seeds. Both the fruit and the seeds grow from parts of the flower.

Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",0.21340893582481552,0.01377316058860911,0.3496503446564625,0.3333333333333333
Select the organism in the same genus as the spot-billed pelican.,"Ardea herodias

Bubo scandiacus",1,1,Pelecanus philippensis,"Answer: B
Explanation: A spot-billed pelican and a pelecanus philippensis are in the same genus. They both have the same first scientific name, Pelecanus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.","A spot-billed pelican and a pelecanus philippensis are in the same genus. They both have the same first scientific name, Pelecanus.

Does Asimina triloba have cells that have a nucleus?,"yes
no",0,0,yes,"Answer: A
Explanation: All living organisms are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells are both types of living cells. Do animal cells and plant cells have the same parts? For the most part, the answer is yes! Both types of cells have cells parts that perform the same functions. Both have cells parts that contain genetic information and control growth. And both have cells parts that break down food and remove waste.
But there are differences between animal cells and plant cells. For example, plant cells have cell walls made of fiber called cellulose. Cellulose is not found in animal cells. Plant cells also have structures called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chloroplasts help plant cells carry out photosynthesis.

Cells are the building blocks of all living things. Plants, animals, fungi, and even microorganisms are made of cells. Cells come in many different shapes and sizes.

Which trait did Pentasteria have? Select the trait you can observe on the fossil.,"red skin
a long tube-shaped body
five arms",2,2,five arms,"Answer: C
Explanation: A fossil is the remaining evidence of an organism from the past. Fossils can come in many shapes and sizes. Often, they contain impressions of, and materials replaced by, the remains, traces, or casts of organisms. Scientists can use fossils to learn about the organism that was present, and the time and place where it lived. This fossil shows five arms. The five arms are a trait of Pentasteria.

Organisms can have very different appearances throughout their lives. These different stages in a single organism's life are called life cycles. As part of some life cycles, an organism may produce a fossil and, over time, turn into a new type of organism.","A fossil is the remaining evidence of an organism from the past.

Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation.

Which of the following could Camille and Lucy's test show?,"if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry",0,0,if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use,"Answer: A
Explanation: People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The results of tests can show whether a problem has been solved sufficiently to meet the design requirements.
When a potential solution is tested, measurements are often used to record the results. It is important that the measurements be accurate and precise. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the actual value. Precision refers to how close measurements are to each other.
There are different ways to test a solution depending on the design. Sometimes scientists and engineers conduct an experiment. An experiment is a test or series of tests carried out in order to answer a question or develop new knowledge.
Other times, observations are used to test a solution. Observations can be made directly by watching, or they can be made indirectly by collecting measurements and other data.","People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

Identify the question that Joe's experiment can best answer.,"Do more bacteria grow in liquid with cinnamon than in liquid without cinnamon?
Does temperature affect how much bacteria can grow in liquid?",0,0,Do more bacteria grow in liquid with cinnamon than in liquid without cinnamon?,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the information given about Joe's experiment.
Joe mixed bacteria into a nutrient-rich liquid where the bacteria could grow. He poured four ounces of the mixture into each of ten glass flasks. In five of the ten flasks, he also added one teaspoon of cinnamon. He allowed the bacteria in the flask to grow overnight in a 37°C room. Then, Joe used a microscope to count the number of bacteria in a small sample from each flask. He compared the amount of bacteria in the liquid with cinnamon to the amount of bacteria in the liquid without cinnamon.
The variable in this experiment is the type of liquid the bacteria grow in. The type of liquid is controlled by whether or not Joe adds one teaspoon of cinnamon to a flask. The main question this experiment answers is about the effect of cinnamon on the growth of the bacteria.
The other question cannot be answered by Joe's experiment. To answer that question, Joe would need to change the temperature of the flask with the bacteria and the flask without the bacteria.","Look at the information given about Joe's experiment.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

If you put a crown on your head, the crown will keep its shape.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Is a turtle shell a mineral?,"no
yes",0,0,no,"Answer: A
Explanation: A turtle shell is not a mineral. It has the body part of a turtle and it is found in nature, but it does not have a fixed crystal structure or a pure composition.

A substance that is a mineral:
- is a chemical compound
- is formed without life playing a role
- has a fixed crystal structure
- has a fixed composition","A turtle shell is not a mineral. It has the body part of a turtle and it is found in nature, but it does not have a fixed crystal structure or a pure composition.

A substance that is a mineral:
- is a chemical compound
- is formed without life playing a role
- has a fixed crystal structure
- has a fixed composition","A turtle shell does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, a turtle shell is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.

"Is the water in a fishbowl a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a liquid
a gas
a solid",0,0,a liquid,"Answer: A
Explanation: The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. Liquids take the shape of their container. The water will take the shape of the fishbowl.

There are three states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in one of three states: solid, liquid, or gas.

A solid has a shape and a volume. The particles that make up a solid are packed in a way that leaves little empty space.
A liquid has a volume but not a shape of its own. Its shape is the shape of its container. The particles that make up a liquid are packed in a way that leaves empty space around them.
A gas has a volume and takes the shape of its container. The particles that make up a gas are packed in a way that there is lots of empty space around them.","The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. Liquids take the shape of their container. The water will take the shape of the fishbowl.

A gas has a volume and takes the shape of its container. The particles that make up a gas are packed in a way that there is lots of empty space around them.","The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour water from a fishbowl into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.27925363599519065,0.13762845318487485,0.45121950773721003,0.3157894736842105

Which type of force from the woman's finger will knock over the domino?,"pull
push",1,1,push,"Answer: B
Explanation: The woman uses her finger to apply a push force to the first domino. This push force will knock over the domino.

Force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object. The amount of force applied to an object can be changed by changing any of the following: the amount of pressure, the size of the area over which the force is applied, or the distance over which the force is applied.
Forces can be combined to find a net force. The net force on an object is the sum of all the forces acting on the object. If the net force on an object is zero, the forces are balanced. If the net force on an object is not zero, the forces are unbalanced and the object accelerates.","The woman uses her finger to apply a push force to the first domino.

Is quartzite a mineral?,"no
yes",0,0,no,"Answer: A
Explanation: Quartzite is not a mineral. Quartzite has the properties of a rock, not a mineral. It is made mostly of quartz, but it is not a pure substance. Quartzite does not have a fixed crystal structure. Instead, quartzite is solid.

Facts about quartzite:

- quartzite is not a pure substance
- quartzite does not have a fixed crystal structure
- quartzite is solid
- quartzite has the properties of a rock, not a mineral","Quartzite is not a mineral. Quartzite has the properties of a rock, not a mineral. It is made mostly of quartz, but it is not a pure substance. Quartzite does not have a fixed crystal structure. Instead, quartzite is solid.

- quartzite does not have a fixed crystal structure
- quartzite is solid
- quartzite has the properties of a rock, not a mineral","Quartzite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, quartzite is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.

Is Polytrichum commune made up of one cell?,"yes
no",1,1,no,"Answer: B
Explanation: Polytrichum commune is a plant. Like other plants, it is not made up of one cell. Instead, it is made up of many cells.

Plants are organisms that grow primarily in a upright or upward direction during growth. Most plants have roots, which anchor the plant in place and take in water and minerals from the soil. Compared to the tiny roots of a grass plant, the roots of a large redwood tree can be enormous.
Unlike animals, which are multicellular organisms, plants are typically multicellular organisms. A multicellular organism is an organism that contains multiple cells organized into tissue, organs, and systems. The cells in a multicellular organism specialize. Specialization allows multicellular organisms to function more efficiently.","Polytrichum commune is a plant. Like other plants, it is not made up of one cell. Instead, it is made up of many cells.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.",1,1,The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.,"B; Both Pair 1 and Pair 2 have the same orientation. Therefore, the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

A magnet can attract or repel other magnets. When magnets attract, we say they are exerting a magnetic force on each other. When magnets repel, we say they are exerting a magnetic force on each other.
The strength of a force is a measure of how hard the force is pushing or pulling. The magnetic force is strongest when opposite poles are closest to each other. The magnetic force is weakest when like poles are closest to each other.
Imagine holding two magnets with their opposite poles facing each other. It takes little effort to move them closer. Now imagine holding two magnets with their like poles facing each other. It takes more effort to move them closer because the magnets repel, or push, each other. If you decrease the distance between the like poles, the amount of effort needed increases.

The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.",2,2,The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice.,"Answer: C
Explanation: Look at the paragraph. It tells you when farmers first developed friendly relationships with cats.
People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.
Now look at each answer choice.

The task uses a Venn diagram with two circles. One circle is labeled ""the Odyssey."" The other circle is labeled ""the Aeneid."" Both circles overlap.
Inside the ""the Odyssey"" circle are these descriptions: ""about the Greek hero Odysseus,"" ""by the Greek poet Homer.""
Inside the ""the Aeneid"" circle are these descriptions: ""about the Trojan hero Aeneas,"" ""by the Roman poet Virgil.""
The section below the circles is labeled ""set after the Trojan War"" and ""epic poem."" Both sentences are inside the overlapping part of the diagram. So, both sentences name similarities between the Odyssey and the Aeneid.
Only sentence, ""They were both written by Virgil."" is inside the ""the Aeneid"" circle and outside the overlapping section. So, this sentence names a difference between the Odyssey and the Aeneid.

Details in a text can help you identify relationships between ideas, people, places, or events. Some texts have diagrams that show these relationships. A diagram uses symbols and/or pictures to represent important information from the text.
When you read, look for the main ideas and how they relate to supporting details. Ask yourself how ideas connect to each other. You can use a diagram such as a Venn diagram or a double-bubble map to organize information, find relationships, and compare ideas.","Dive into your textbook to find information that helps you decide which words go in each section of the Venn diagram.

"Which animal's feet are also adapted for walking on large, floating leaves?","Magellan penguin
purple gallinule",1,1,purple gallinule,"Answer: B
Explanation: Look at the picture of the bronze-winged jacana.
The bronze-winged jacana has webbed feet. Its feet are adapted for walking on large, floating leaves. The bronze-winged jacana uses its feet to spread its weight out over a wide area. This helps the bird walk on the leaves without sinking into the water.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The magellan penguin has webbed feet. Its feet are adapted for swimming.
The purple gallinule has webbed feet. Its feet are adapted for swimming.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim. Feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground.","Look at the picture of the bronze-winged jacana.

Which trait did Diplomystus have? Select the trait you can observe on the fossil.,"reddish-orange scales on its body
a V-shaped tail fin",1,1,a V-shaped tail fin,"Answer: B
Explanation: A fossil is the remaining evidence of an organism from the past. Fossils can come in many shapes and sizes. Often, they contain impressions of, and materials replaced by, the original remains. Scientists can use fossils to learn about the organism that created the fossil, such as its appearance, behavior patterns, and the kind of environment it lived in. Diplomystus was an ancient fish. Like other fish, Diplomystus had a V-shaped tail fin.

An organism's traits come from its parents. Traits are characteristics that the Organism has because of genes passed down from its parents, such as blue eyes or a ability to run fast. Other characteristics, like a tall stature, may be the result of how an organism lives. For example, a person who eats lots of vegetables may be taller than a person who does not eat many vegetables, but that taller person is not necessarily taller because of a gene passed down from parents.","A fossil is the remaining evidence of an organism from the past.

Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.

When there is a drought, people, plants, and animals can be affected negatively. Rivers and ponds have less water, so there is not as much water available for people to use. Plants and trees may drop leaves early. Animals and plants that depend on a river for water may move to a different area.

A riverbed is the bottom part of a river. The term ""riverbed"" refers to the part of the river that is below the water's surface.
During a drought, a riverbed may become dry and cracked. This is because there is not as much water in the river as usual.","A drought happens when an area gets less rain or snow than usual for a long time.

How do you look for evidence of a change to Earth's surface?
There are many ways to find evidence of a change to Earth's surface. One way is to look at a picture that was taken after the change.
Here are some examples of what the evidence for different changes might be:
Cause of the change | Evidence of the change
earthquake | cracks in the ground; houses with broken walls and roofs
volcanic eruption | melted rock on Earth's surface; smoke coming out of a hole in the ground
erosion | a canyon with a river flowing through it; a river carrying sand and mud
Be careful when you are looking for evidence!
A picture of Earth's surface can contain a lot of information. Some of that information might be evidence of a change to the surface, but some of it is not!
For example, a picture taken after an earthquake might show a blue sky. But the color of the sky is not evidence of an earthquake. So, that information is not evidence that an earthquake happened.",0.23997774079868464,0.007187245457854399,0.18994412912331088,0.07142857142857142
Which better describes the Gunung Leuser National Park ecosystem?,"It has year-round warm temperatures. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.
It has cold winters. It also has soil that is rich in nutrients.",0,0,It has year-round warm temperatures. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.,"Answer: A
Explanation: Temperatures vary little in tropical rain forest ecosystems. The soil is poor in nutrients. This ecosystem is located on an old ocean floor. The soil washed away over time.

The climate and soil in a place can affect the animals and plants that live there. Think about how these factors affect the organisms at Gunung Leuser National Park.
Temperature is one part of the climate of an area. The higher the temperature, the faster many chemical reactions occur. For example, foods will spoil much faster at higher temperatures. Animals and plants need to replace the energy they use for these chemical reactions. As the temperature gets higher, animals and plants typically need to increase their rate of food intake.
Soils form as rocks and other materials break down into small particles over long periods of time. Rainfall is important for this breakdown. It washes water and air through the upper layers of broken materials. Over time, this can create rich, dark soil. Wetting and drying the particles in the soil helps break them into small particles. 
The climate and soil of an area affect the organisms that live there by affecting what types of organisms can grow and stay healthy there.","Temperatures vary little in tropical rain forest ecosystems.

Explanation: Look at the arrows pointing to the earthworm. They show which organisms matter moves to, not from. Follow the arrow that points to the earthworm. It starts at the barren-ground caribou. This means that the matter in the barren-ground caribou moves to the earthworm.

Every organism needs matter to stay alive. Organisms get their matter by eating other organisms. This is called a food web.
An arrow points to an organism to show what that organism eats. An arrow points from an organism to show what that organism is eaten by.","Look at the arrows pointing to the earthworm.

An arrow points to an organism to show what that organism eats. An arrow points from an organism to show what that organism is eaten by.","Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the earthworm.
Arrows point from the barren-ground caribou to the grizzly bear and the mushroom. The only arrow pointing from the grizzly bear leads to the mushroom. No arrows point from the mushroom to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the barren-ground caribou to the earthworm.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.",0.06452034756403001,0.035811059015956784,0.40506328748597986,0.35
Which animal's skin is better adapted as a warning sign to ward off predators?,"opalescent nudibranch
lechwe",0,0,opalescent nudibranch,"Answer: A
Explanation: An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The color of an animal's skin is one example of an adaptation. Animals' colors help them survive. For example, the dark color of a reindeer's winter coat helps hide it from predators. The reindeer's dark color does not help it stay warm, but its shape does. The reindeer has a rounded body covered with fur. This shape helps the reindeer hold its own body heat.
Different animals have different adaptations. Scientists use this information to put animals into groups. An animal's adaptations help scientists figure out how and where the animal lives, what it eats, and what adapts it to its environment.","An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce.

Hydrogen fluoride is ().","an elementary substance
a compound",1,1,a compound,"Answer: B
Explanation: A compound is a substance made up of two or more different elements that are chemically combined. Hydrogen fluoride is a compound because it is made up of two different elements that are chemically combined.
An elementary substance is a substance that:
■ is made up of only one element.
■ cannot be changed into other substances through chemical changes.
Because hydrogen fluoride is a compound, it is not an elementary substance.

A substance's malleability is a property of its matter. Malleability is the ability of a substance to be pounded into thin sheets.
The malleability of a substance depends on how easily the bonds between particles in the substance can be changed. If the particles are held tightly, the substance will not be malleable. If the particles are not held tightly, the substance will be very malleable.
Many metals are highly malleable. For example, copper is so malleable that it can be pounded into a thin sheet just by using a hammer!
Carbon is not malleable. Diamond, which is made of carbon, cannot be pounded into a sheet.","A compound is a substance made up of two or more different elements that are chemically combined.

Identify the question that Laura's experiment can best answer.,"Does the humidity level where tomato seeds are planted affect the number of tomato seedlings that grow?
Do more tomato seedlings grow when they are planted in soil with fertilizer compared to soil without fertilizer?",1,1,Do more tomato seedlings grow when they are planted in soil with fertilizer compared to soil without fertilizer?,"Answer: B
Explanation: Look at the information provided about the experiment.
Laura planted 25 tomato seeds one-half inch below the soil surface in each of six pots. This part tells you that both groups of seeds were treated the same way.
Laura added an equal amount of fertilizer to three of the six pots. This part tells you that the two groups of seeds were different in that one group had fertilizer and one group did not.
She placed the pots in a plant growth chamber where all the seeds experienced the same temperature, amount of light, and humidity level.
After two weeks, Laura counted the number of seedlings that grew in each pot. She compared the number of seedlings in the pots with fertilizer to the number of seedlings in the pots without fertilizer.
The variable was whether or not the pots had fertilizer. The controlled factor was the temperature, amount of light, and humidity level that all the seeds experienced.
The experiment can answer questions about how fertilizer affects the number of seedlings that grow. It cannot answer questions about how humidity affects the number of seedlings that grow.

You do not need to know which specific plants Laura used to answer the question. The type of plant is a controlled factor, or something that is held constant, in the experiment.","Look at the information provided about the experiment.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.",0,0,The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.,"Answer: A
Explanation: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the strength of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the strength of the magnetic force between them is stronger.
There is a shorter distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is how hard the force is pushing or pulling. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the left than to the right
to the right than to the left",0,1,to the right than to the left,"Answer: B
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration until they are evenly distributed.
Sometimes, the solute particles in a solution move faster and move farther than usual. For example, if you add table salt to water, the salt particles might start out at one side of your solution. Over time, they will diffuse—moving quickly in all directions—until they are evenly distributed.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

Over time, they will diffuse—moving quickly in all directions—until they are evenly distributed.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.3978233990480966,0.157472981256932,0.4748858397497967,0.42424242424242425
Select the organism in the same genus as the red kangaroo.,"Cervus canadensis

Explanation: An organism's genus often includes many organisms that look similar to each other. A genus is made up of organisms that share many characteristics. The organisms in the same genus are more alike than the organisms in different genera.
Scientists use genus names to help them create classification systems. In a classification system, the groups called genera are smaller than the groups called families.
All organisms have a genus name and a species name in their scientific name. For example, the scientific name of the gray wolf is Canis lupus. 'Canis' is the genus name. 'Lupus' is the species name.

Explanation: Look at the colors of each animal.
The colors of the sharpnose-puffer's skin are bright and vivid. They are adapted to ward off predators.
The color of the gray tree frog is dull. It is not adapted to ward off predators because it is hard for predators to see the frog.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's body is one example of an adaptation. Animals that live in different ways can have adaptations that seem very different, but help the same way.
For example, the diet of a purple orchid butterfly and a giraffe may seem very different. But both animals have long tongues. They use their long tongues for the same adaptation. The long tongue helps them reach food that other animals can't reach.","Look at the colors of each animal.

Explanation: Pollination is what happens when pollen lands on a female cone.

A plant makes pollen in its male cones. Pollination happens when pollen lands on a female cone. Then, fertilization can occur, and maybe seeds will develop.
Either wind or insects can blow or carry pollen from a male cone to a female cone. This plant makes its pollen in its male cones, shown in the diagram. The pollen can be blown by the wind to a female cone, shown here.","Pollination is what happens when pollen lands on a female cone.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample B
sample A",2,2,sample A,"Answer: C
Explanation: The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The average kinetic energy of the particles is determined by both their mass and their average speed. The smaller the mass of a particle, the greater the effect of its speed on its kinetic energy. So, to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in the two samples, first compare the masses of the particles in each sample. Then, compare the average speeds of the particles in each sample.
The mass of each particle in sample A is greater than the mass of each particle in sample B. The average speed of the particles in sample A is greater than the average speed of the particles in sample B. So, even though increasing mass has a greater effect on average kinetic energy than increasing speed, the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample A is greater than the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the greater average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

An object's temperature is an measure of the average of the objects particles' kinetic energies.","The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance.

"Based on the arrows, which of the following living things is an omnivore?","phytoplankton
plainfin midshipman",1,1,plainfin midshipman,"Answer: B
Explanation: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a series of arrows that lead to or from the same living thing. An omnivore eats both plants and other animals. In this food web, the plainfin midshipman is shown with arrows pointing to it from both zooplankton and kelp. Zooplankton is a type of planktonic animal, and kelp is a type of plant. So, the plainfin midshipman is shown eating both animals and plants. The other living things in this food web are shown eating only one type of organism.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows move from top to bottom.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves. Matter moves from an organism that gets its food from something else to an organism that eats something else. In this food web, each arrow goes from a circle with a plant to a circle with an animal.
Organisms in a food web are producers, consumers, or decomposers.
- Producers are organisms that make their own food. Plants are producers.
- Consumers are organisms that get their food from other organisms. All consumers are either a primary consumer, a secondary consumer, and so on.
  - Primary consumers are organisms that eat producers.
  - Secondary consumers are organisms that eat primary consumers.
  - Tertiary consumers are organisms that eat secondary consumers.
  - Quaternary consumers are organisms that eat tertiary consumers.
- Decomposers are organisms that break down dead organic matter. Both decomposers and consumers get their food from producers or other consumers. So, both decomposers and consumers are part of a food web's arrows.
Matter moves from top to bottom in an food web.
Arrow directions show how matter moves from one organism to another. In this food web, there are many arrows that move from top to bottom. So, matter moves from one level to the next in these food chains. Some of these food chains begin with a producer and end with a tertiary or quaternary consumer.","Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web.

So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is a producer, not an omnivore.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton, which is a producer. The plainfin midshipman also has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton, which is a consumer. The plainfin midshipman eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.

"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
The volume of Mars is more than three times as large as Mercury's.","false
true",0,0,false,"Answer: A.
Explanation: Use the information in the table to calculate the ratio of Mars's volume to Mercury's volume.
160 billion km³ ÷ 60 billion km³ = 2.67
This means the volume of Mars is about 2.67 times as large as Mercury's.

A planet's volume is a measure of its size. To understand why planets with larger volumes also have larger surface areas, consider how volume and surface area increase with the size of a ball. A larger ball has more volume because it takes up more space, but it also has more surface area because you need more area to cover a larger ball.","Use the information in the table to calculate the ratio of Mars's volume to Mercury's volume.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.",2,2,The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.,"C
Explanation: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is the same distance between the magnets in both pairs. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets.","The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel.

Explanation: People use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.","People use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems.

Air is a gas. A gas can be compressed into a smaller space. It can also be expanded to a larger space.","The air inside a basketball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air fills all the space inside the basketball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Which solution has a higher concentration of green particles?,"Solution A
Solution B
neither; their concentrations are the same",1,1,Solution B,"Answer: B
Explanation: The more particles of solute there are in a given amount of solvent, the higher the concentration of a solution is. In Solution A, there are more green particles than blue particles. In Solution B, there are fewer green particles than blue particles. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles than Solution B.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The substance that is dissolved is the solute. The substance doing the dissolving is the solvent.
The concentration of a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Think about pouring a given amount of soda from one cup to two different glasses. The soda in each glass is the solute. The rest of the solution is water. The same amount of soda is in both glasses, but there is more water in the first glass you poured into than in the second glass. So, the first glass has a lower concentration of soda, and the second glass has a higher concentration of soda.
So, when more solute particles are mixed into a given amount of solvent, the solution's concentration increases. When more solvent is mixed into a given amount of solute, the solution's concentration decreases.","The more particles of solute there are in a given amount of solvent, the higher the concentration of a solution is.

To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.5570776255707762,0.29740578336422996,0.47798741638859227,0.4666666666666667

Which of these continents does the prime meridian intersect?,"Europe
Australia
North America",0,0,Europe,"Answer: A
Explanation: The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Europe. It does not intersect Australia or North America.

The lines on a map that show latitude and longitude help people find places. These lines are imaginary lines drawn on maps and Earth. The lines of latitude are called circles. Imagine drawing a circle around Earth. This circle would be a line of latitude. There is a special line of latitude called the equator. It shows the line around Earth where the northern and southern halves are the same size. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are drawn from the north pole to the south pole. This makes each line of longitude vertical on a map. The lines of longitude are also called meridians. The prime meridian is the meridian that shows 0° longitude. It passes through Greenwich, England.","The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Europe.

It does not intersect North America or Australia.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",0.32533148118362404,0.17585094300012866,0.519774006415781,0.4318181818181818

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.",2,0,The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.,"A. The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
Magnetic forces are greatest between magnets that have opposite orientations. They are weakest when the magnets have similar orientations.

Many places in the world receive lots of rain. But deserts are different. Deserts are some of the driest places on Earth! Why are deserts so dry? It depends on their location.
Location affects whether a place gets wet or dry. Deserts are usually located in two places. Some are close to oceans. Others are far from water sources. Deserts that are near oceans are far enough away that clouds do not usually reach them. Deserts that are far from water sources already have dry air.
Oceans, lakes, and other large sources of water can affect weather and climate. Areas near these water sources often get more rain. Areas far from these water sources often get less rain.

The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.",0.6295292203121988,0.5418056803378862,0.7479674746909909,0.6363636363636364

Which of the following could Tara and Rosanne's test show?,"if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry
if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use",1,1,if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use,"Answer: B
Explanation: People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The steps of this process are commonly described using the acronym PDCA, where P stands for plan, D stands for do, C stands for check, and A stands for act.
When engineers test a solution, they might:
- Use measurements to collect data
- Perform multiple trials
The slump test described in the passage is an example of a test that engineers use to test a potential solution.
Engineers may test a variety of solutions before deciding on the best one. Tara and Rosanne's slump test could help them decide if a batch of concrete is firm enough to use. If the concrete collapsed when they lifted the cone, they would know the batch should not be used. Otherwise, they would know the batch is firm enough to use.","People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.29331812793240564,0.09802370226272614,0.31016042282478773,0.2558139534883721

Which statement describes the Sonoran Desert ecosystem?,"It has many different types of organisms.
It has thick, moist soil.
It has only a few types of organisms.",0,0,It has many different types of organisms.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A ecosystem is defined as the relationship between a particular area's living and nonliving things. So, a ecosystem includes that area's organisms and the environment.
There are many different types of organisms in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem, and those organisms interact with the environment. For example, the Sonoran Desert has many different types of cacti and other plants. These plants compete for water in the dry environment. Organisms in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem need to adapt to stay healthy and alive.

Organisms in an ecosystem are connected to each other and their environment by energy and matter. Energy moves through an ecosystem in one direction. Sunlight energy enters the ecosystem as matter. Plants use this energy to grow. Animals use the plants as a source of food and energy. Decomposers return some matter to the soil, which plants can use.","A ecosystem is defined as the relationship between a particular area's living and nonliving things.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Which term matches the picture?,"respiratory system
circulatory system",1,1,circulatory system,"Answer: B
Explanation: Your circulatory system is made up of blood vessels and the heart. It moves blood throughout your body. Your heart is a pump that sends blood throughout your circulatory system.

Every minute, your heart beats about 100 to 120 times. That's about 72,000 times each day! Your circulatory system helps keep you healthy by delivering oxygen and nutrients to the cells in your body and removing waste products.

Other body systems have special jobs. But the circulatory system is very important because it connects to and helps deliver materials to almost every cell in your body.

A respiratory system helps you breathe. It is made up of organs such as the nose, mouth, throat, larynx, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. Gas exchange happens in the lungs. Oxygen passes from the air in your lungs to the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cell activity, passes from the blood into the lungs. From there, you breathe out the carbon dioxide.","Your circulatory system is made up of blood vessels and the heart. It moves blood throughout your body.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.",0,0,The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.,"Answer: A
Explanation: The magnets in Pair 2 have more distance between them than the magnets in Pair 1. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
The strength of magnetism is the force of attraction or repulsion between magnets. The strength of magnetism can be affected by distance and materials. Distance affects the strength of magnetism. The stronger the magnetism is, the greater the distance between the magnets.
There are two types of forces: contact and noncontact. Contact forces act on objects that are touching. Noncontact forces act on objects that are not touching. Gravity is a force of attraction. It acts without touching between any two matter that has mass.","The magnets in Pair 2 have more distance between them than the magnets in Pair 1. The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.

Both magnets in Pair 1 attract the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is the same in either direction. So, the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is how hard the force is pushing or pulling. You can describe the strength of a magnetic force by how much effort is needed to move one magnet toward or away from the other.
Think about trying to move one of the magnets in each pair toward the other magnet.
In Pair 1, the magnets are repelling. So, you would have to use as much effort to move one magnet away from the other.
In Pair 2, the magnets are attracting. But you would still have to use that same amount of effort to move one magnet toward the other. Distance affects the strength of a magnetic force. The stronger the force, the more likely the magnets are to move toward each other or push apart. The weaker the force, the more likely one magnet is to stay close to the other without moving. The magnets in Pair 2 are attracting. And they are only 3 inches apart. You would have to use the same amount of effort to move one magnet toward the other in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.","The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel.

"Complete the text to describe the diagram.
Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the right than to the left
to the left than to the right",0,0,to the right than to the left,"Answer: A
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration until they are evenly distributed.
Sometimes, the solute particles in a solution move faster and move farther during diffusion. The rate of diffusion is affected by three factors: temperature, concentration gradient, and surface area.
• Higher temperatures lead to higher rates of diffusion. This is because increased temperature gives solute particles more energy. They move faster and can travel greater distances between collisions.
• A steeper concentration gradient leads to a higher rate of diffusion. The concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two areas. In the equation below, [A] represents the concentration of the solute in an area.
   concentration gradient = [A]substance A in area A − [A]substance A in area B
• A larger surface area increases the rate of diffusion. With a larger surface area, there are more solute particles near the boundary between the two areas.
During diffusion, solute particles move until they are evenly distributed. In the saltwater solution, this means that the salt particles will eventually be evenly distributed between the water and the air above the water.
There is a way to make solute particles move faster during diffusion. You can increase the temperature of the solution. Increasing the temperature gives the particles more energy. Therefore, they move faster and can travel greater distances between collisions.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

There is a way to make solute particles move faster during diffusion. You can increase the temperature of the solution. Increasing the temperature gives the particles more energy. Therefore, they move faster and can travel greater distances between collisions.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.425531914893617,0.15834227752577576,0.41698841209045784,0.42424242424242425

Facts about granite:
- granite has no fixed crystal structure
- granite is rock, not a pure substance
- granite has no definite, fixed composition","Granite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, granite is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:

It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.

Does this passage describe the weather or the climate?,"climate
weather",0,0,climate,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows Lake Titicaca.
Lake Titicaca is a large, deep lake on the border between Peru and Bolivia. Dry, windy conditions are common each year in June, July, and August.
Because Lake Titicaca is a pattern of dry, windy conditions that happens each year, this describes the climate.

A passage that describes the atmosphere at one place and time is about the weather. The temperature today is an example of weather.
A passage that describes the average atmosphere over many places and long periods of time is about the climate. A description of the average summer high temperatures for a city is an example of climate.","The image shows Lake Titicaca.

"Based on the arrows, which of the following organisms is a producer?","lichen
barren-ground caribou",0,0,lichen,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the arrows pointing to and coming out of each organism. These arrows represent what each organism eats. If an arrow points to an organism, then that organism is a consumer. Producers are the only organisms that can make their own food. They do not eat anything. Therefore, a producer does not have any arrows pointing to it.
The barren-ground caribou has arrows pointing to it, so it is a consumer.
The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. However, there are arrows pointing away from the lichen. So, the lichen is a producer.

Organisms depend on one another and on their environment. This depends on the flow of matter through energy sources. This is called a food web.
An arrow in a food web points from the organism that is eaten to the organism that is eating.","Look at the arrows pointing to and coming out of each organism.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.3142810067802063,0.12131494738233717,0.5398772956287403,0.5

Does Rhizophora mangle have cells that have a nucleus?,"yes
no",0,0,yes,"Answer: A
Explanation: All living organisms are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells are both types of living cells. Like all living cells, plant cells have a cell membrane and a nucleus.
The cell membrane is the cell's thin outer boundary. It controls which materials can enter and leave the cell.
Inside the cell membrane is the nucleus. This organellle is the control center of the cell. It contains information that tells the cell how to grow and what to do.

Living things are made of cells. Cells have different jobs, but all cells have a nucleus.

Select the true statement.,"Genes affect traits.
Eye color is an example of a gene.",0,0,Genes affect traits.,"Answer: A
Explanation: Genes affect traits. Traits are passed from parents to offspring. Eye color is an example of a trait.
An organism's genes affect its traits. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect traits. Embryos get their genes from their parents. Parents pass different genes on to their embryos. The version of a gene an embryo receives from each parent is what makes up its pair of alleles for a trait. An organism's alleles affect the trait it has for that trait. A trait can have different forms, or alleles, just like the pairs of socks you have in your drawer might all be the same color and style, but have different patterns on them.
Different versions of a gene can cause the same trait to look very different. Hair color is a trait controlled by multiple genes. Hair color can be determined by how light or dark the hair is, how much pigment, or color, is in the hair, and how much hair is present. Hair color can have many different alleles. Very light brown, light brown, and dark brown are examples of alleles for hair color.
The alleles an organism has for a trait affect which trait is expressed, or seen. Sometimes, one allele in a pair will have a greater effect on the expressed trait than the other allele. When this happens, the allele that has a greater effect is called dominant. The expressed trait may or may not be the same as the dominant allele. The allele that is not expressed is called recessive.
Hair color is always dominated by the dark allele. Even if an organism has two dark alleles for hair color, its hair color will still be dark.","Genes affect traits. Traits are passed from parents to offspring. Eye color is an example of a trait.

Explanation: An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help grab and hold meat. A long, thin mouth might help pick up small insects more easily.
Think about how different animals' mouths are adapted.

Animals with different adaptations may also have different numbers of toes. The number of toes is an adaptation that helps the animal use its feet in the way that it needs to.
Different animals have different adaptations for capture, hold, and grab. These adaptations help the animals use their mouths to catch and hold different types of food. Their mouths are adapted in the way that they are shaped.","An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.

Will these magnets attract or repel each other?,"attract
repel",0,0,attract,"Answer: A
Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.36455696202531646,0.12623023964630156,0.5316455646402821,0.4594594594594595

Solution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.

Which better describes the Peary Land ecosystem?,"It has short, cold summers. It also has many trees and shrubs.
It has long, cold winters. It also has mostly small plants.",1,1,"It has long, cold winters. It also has mostly small plants.","Answer: B
Explanation: Every place on Earth has a unique ecosystem. The main differences are caused by climate. Climate is usually described in terms of temperature and rainfall.
There are many factors that influence climate, such as the amount of sunlight and the patterns of ocean currents. These factors influence climate on a scale from equator to pole.
People can also influence climate. By adding large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the global climate is changed. This is known as global warming.
The type of ecosystem in a place is mainly influenced by the local climate. It determines which animals and plants can live there.
Use the following steps to think about how climate influences ecosystems:
Step 1: Consider the average temperatures. The temperature affects what plants can grow. It also affects the types of animals that can live there.
Step 2: Think about how much rain or snow falls. This affects the plants that can grow. Water availability can also determine how dense, or crowded, an ecosystem is.
Be sure to check the answers against the question. The question asks which ecosystem is better described by the picture.

Tundras have the following features: long, cold winters and short, cold summers, soil that is frozen year-round, and mostly small plants. So, Peary Land has long, cold winters. It also has mostly small plants.

An environment includes all of the biotic, or living, and abiotic, or nonliving, things in an area. An ecosystem is created by the relationships that form among the biotic and abiotic parts of an environment.
There are many different types of terrestrial, or land-based, ecosystems. Here are some ways in which terrestrial ecosystems can differ from each other:
the pattern of weather, or climate
the type of soil

Which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles?,"Solution B
Solution A
neither; their concentrations are the same",0,0,Solution B,"Answer: A
Explanation: The more solute there is in a solution, the higher its concentration is. In Solution A and Solution B, the solvents are the same amount. There are more yellow particles in Solution B than in Solution A, so Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles than Solution A.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The substance that is mixed into another substance is the solute. The substance that is mixed into a solute is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent","The more solute there is in a solution, the higher its concentration is. In Solution A and Solution B, the solvents are the same amount. There are more yellow particles in Solution B than in Solution A, so Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles than Solution A.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The substance that is mixed into another substance is the solute. The substance that is mixed into a solute is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent","In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.5270006324553916,0.43808266489452535,0.642335761617561,0.5

It has water with not much salt. It also has many different types of organisms.",0,0,It has salty water. It also has many different types of organisms.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A tropical coral reef is a type of ecosystem. An ecosystem is a community of living things that are connected to each other in an environment. Your environment is made up of all the nonliving things and living things in your setting. Settings can be as large as a forest or as small as a bottle of soda.
There are many different types of ecosystems. The table below shows some examples.
| Type of Ecosystem | Description |
| desert | hot and dry, with little rain or water |
| forest | an area with many trees, such as an evergreen pine tree or a maple tree |
| freshwater | made up of fresh, or nonsalt, water, such as in a lake or river |
| marine | made up of salt water, such as in an ocean or a pond |
Every ecosystem has living and nonliving things. Living things include plants, animals, and other organisms. Nonliving things include rocks, air, and water.
Living things in an ecosystem are connected to each other. They rely on each other in different ways. For example, a plant makes food for itself through photosynthesis. This food is eaten by a flowering crab. So, the flowering crab relies on the plant.
Water is a nonliving thing that is found in an ecosystem. Water can be connected to living things in an ecosystem. For example, a shark lives in and moves through water.","A tropical coral reef is a type of ecosystem. An ecosystem is a community of living things that are connected to each other in an environment.

This organism and the gray heron have the same scientific genus, Ardea. They both have blue-gray feathers and long legs.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

A bowling ball is a solid because:
1. The molecules that make up a bowling ball are closely connected to each other.
2. The molecules do not move freely but are fixed in place.","A bowling ball is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A bowling ball can knock down bowling pins. But after it hits the pins, the bowling ball still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.001266978941884534,0.00035605810224318595,0.2058823496712803,0.07692307692307693

Which trait did Curculioides adompha have? Select the trait you can observe on the fossil.,"red eyes
eight legs",1,1,eight legs,"Answer: B
Explanation: A fossil is the remaining evidence of an organism from the past. Fossils can be preserved animals, plants, and other organisms. Other fossils contain leaves, flowers, or other body parts. The fossil in the question is Curculioides adompha. Curculioides adompha is an eight-legged arachnid. Eight legs is a trait of Curculioides adompha that can be observed from this fossil.

Organisms change over time. Scientists use fossils, the remains of organisms that lived long ago, to learn about organisms that lived long ago. Fossils can tell scientists what organisms looked like. They can also tell scientists what traits an organism had. Using fossils, scientists can make a record of how some organisms changed over time.","A fossil is the remaining evidence of an organism from the past.

They can also tell scientists what traits an organism had. Using fossils, scientists can make a record of how some organisms changed over time.","The way an organism looks or acts is called a trait. Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.23322435532042576,0.013155746208918764,0.4121212072022039,0.3333333333333333

Arctic foxes are secondary consumers. They eat the brown lemming, which is a primary consumer.","Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The mushroom has arrows pointing to it from the barren-ground caribou and the grizzly bear. Neither the barren-ground caribou nor the grizzly bear is a producer, so the earthworm is not a primary consumer.
The Arctic fox has an arrow pointing to it from the bilberry. The bilberry is a producer, so the Arctic fox is a primary consumer.
The barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. The lichen is a producer, so the barren-ground caribou is a primary consumer.
The rough-legged hawk has an arrow pointing to it from the parasitic jaeger. The parasitic jaeger is not a producer, so the rough-legged hawk is not a primary consumer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Is diamond a mineral?,"no
yes",1,1,yes,"Answer: B
Explanation: A diamond is a mineral. It has fixed crystal structures. It is also made by living things.

Minerals have fixed crystal structures. This means that the atoms that make up the minerals repeat in the same order over and over.
Most minerals are made of elements combined as compounds. The compound sulfur dioxide is an example of a mineral. Some minerals, like diamond, are made of only one element. Minerals are not made by living things.","A diamond is a mineral. It has fixed crystal structures. It is also made by living things.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.1141709211416599,0.034630538592891294,0.38095237638021195,0.20588235294117646

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",0.5312585985642254,0.33340249841163905,0.505617972533771,0.46511627906976744

Will these magnets attract or repel each other?,"repel
attract",0,1,attract,"Answer: B
Explanation: The magnets are attracting each other. When one magnet is held near another, there is a force between the two magnets. This force can cause the magnets to move toward or away from each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. The direction of the pull or push is called magnetic force.
Magnetic force is strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. If similar, or the same, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. Magnet poles that are closest to each other in a attracting magnet-magnet combination are never similar.

Use the diagram below to identify the poles. The north pole of Magnet A is closest to the south pole of Magnet B. Like this, opposite poles are closest to each other. So, the magnets attract each other.","The magnets are attracting each other. When one magnet is held near another, there is a force between the two magnets.

If the problem has been identified and is clear
If the solution solves the problem
If the solution meets any requirements that were set
If the solution is feasible, or if it is likely to work
Test results can be shown using charts, graphs, and other types of visual displays. It is important for people to repeat tests to make sure that the results are reproducible.

If a potential solution has been tested and reproduces the same results, people can have greater confidence in the solution.","People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

"Complete the text to describe the diagram.
Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the left than to the right
to the right than to the left",1,1,to the right than to the left,"Answer: B
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. Areas of high concentration have more solute particles. Areas of low concentration have fewer solute particles.
As the solute moves, it diffuses through the solvent. Diffusion of solute particles happens until the solute is evenly distributed in the solvent. This is called equilibrium. Equilibrium happens when there is an equal concentration of solute particles on both sides of a membrane.
The membrane between two regions can be a container with two parts separated by a permeable barrier. Permeable means that particles can move through the membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. If more solute particles move out of an area in one direction than in the other direction, the concentration difference changes. Over time, more and more solute particles will move to balance the concentrations on each side.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

If more solute particles move out of an area in one direction than in the other direction, the concentration difference changes. Over time, more and more solute particles will move to balance the concentrations on each side.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.5365853658536586,0.14446766341552428,0.48535564354615646,0.4117647058823529

"Is fruit punch a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a solid
a liquid
a gas",1,1,a liquid,"B
Explanation: Fruit punch is a liquid. It has a volume and takes the shape of its container.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size and shape of its own, but it does not have a fixed size or shape. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.","Fruit punch is a liquid. It has a volume and takes the shape of its container.

"Complete the statement.
Hydrogen peroxide is ().","a compound
an elementary substance",0,0,a compound,"Answer: A
Explanation: Hydrogen peroxide is a compound. It is made of two different types of atoms.
The model shows that a molecule of hydrogen peroxide has two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. When chemical bonds connect atoms in a molecule, the different atoms contribute their own share of electrons to fill their valence shells. In hydrogen peroxide, each of the hydrogen atoms shares its single electron with one of the oxygen atoms to complete its valence shell. Each of the two oxygen atoms then shares its two electrons with the other oxygen atom to complete its valence shell.

More information:
A compound is a substance made of two or more different types of atoms bonded together. The types of atoms in a compound are always the same, and the number of atoms of each type is always in the same ratio.
In a water molecule, for example, there are always two hydrogen atoms for every one oxygen atom. So, water is a compound with the formula H2O.
An elementary substance is made of only one type of atom.
Example: The elementary substance carbon (C) is found on Earth as diamond and graphite.","Hydrogen peroxide is a compound. It is made of two different types of atoms.

Explanation: This map shows the thirteen colonies that became the United States. There are three main regions shown on the map. The Middle Colonies include Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware.

A colony is a settlement of people from one country living under the rule of that country in a distant area. In the late 1600s and 1700s, many people from Europe tried to start colonies in the land we now call the United States. By 1750, there were 13 European colonies in this area. They were organized into three main regions: the New England Colonies, the Middle Colonies, and the Southern Colonies.","This map shows the thirteen colonies that became the United States.

But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.

Select the chemical formula for this molecule.,"PCl5N
PCl5
P2Cl6
Cl6",1,1,PCl5,"B
Explanation: The subscript 5 means there are five chlorines. The P comes from phosphorus in the word chlorine. So, the chemical formula is PCl5.

A compound is made from two or more different elements. The element symbols and subscripts in a chemical compound represent its chemical formula. The chemical formula shows what elements are in the compound and the ratio of the atoms.
Every element has its own symbol. An element's symbol is often shown on its periodic table entry. We write element symbols with one or two capital letters. Consider the element boron. Its symbol is B.
A subscript is used when elements have more than one ion with the same charge. The subscript tells you how many of that ion are in the compound. For example, in CaCl2, the 2 in CaCl2 is the subscript for Cl. It tells you that each molecule of calcium chloride contains two chloride ions.","The subscript 5 means there are five chlorines.

For example, in CaCl2, the 2 in CaCl2 is the subscript for Cl. It tells you that each molecule of calcium chloride contains two chloride ions.","P is the symbol for phosphorus. Cl is the symbol for chlorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one phosphorus atom and five chlorine atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols P and Cl. There is one phosphorus atom, so P will not have a subscript. There are five chlorine atoms, so Cl will have a subscript of 5.
The correct formula is PCl5.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.1447662243519546,0.02641513976969111,0.4774774726738901,0.26666666666666666
Which air temperature was measured within the outlined area shown?,"30°C

Explanation: To find the air temperature within the outlined area, locate the outlined area on the map.
The color of the outlined area is the same as the color of the key labeled 14°.
Therefore, the air temperature within the outlined area was 14°C.

A map contains information about the air temperature. The map shows the physical location of different air temperatures in the lower atmosphere.","To find the air temperature within the outlined area, locate the outlined area on the map.

Therefore, the air temperature within the outlined area was 14°C.

A map contains information about the air temperature. The map shows the physical location of different air temperatures in the lower atmosphere.","Look at the colors shown within the outlined area. Then, use the legend to determine which air temperatures those colors represent.
The legend tells you that this air mass contained air with temperatures between 25°C and 35°C.
30°C is within this range.
10°C and 14°C are outside of this range.

To study air masses, scientists can use maps that show conditions within Earth's atmosphere. For example, the map below uses color to show air temperatures.
The map's legend tells you the temperature that each color represents. Colors on the left in the legend represent lower temperatures than colors on the right. For example, areas on the map that are the darkest shade of blue have a temperature from -25°C up to -20°C. Areas that are the next darkest shade of blue have a temperature from -20°C up to -15°C.",0.17740325340490445,0.010391641840211418,0.31578946936288094,0.25

A bubble is a pocket of air, or gas, surrounded by liquid. Air is a gas.","a gas

A bubble is a pocket of air, or gas, surrounded by liquid. Air is a gas.","The air inside a bubble is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air inside a bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",1.4607895050077023e-06,4.5913698562044935e-07,0.12598425000682004,0.07317073170731707

Explanation: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

Which better describes the Everglades National Park ecosystem?,"It has land that is covered in water during most of the year. It also has other water ecosystems nearby.
It has soil that is poor in nutrients. It also has other water ecosystems nearby.",0,0,It has land that is covered in water during most of the year. It also has other water ecosystems nearby.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A water ecosystem is an ecosystem that is found in a large body of water. Wetlands are examples of water ecosystems.
Soil is made up of small particles. Animals, decaying plant and animal matter, and rocks can all affect how particles are distributed in soil.
The particles in a soil type affect its texture. Soil type is an important part of a soil's texture. Soil type does not change over time.
There are four different soil types, and each type has a different particle distribution:
In a clay soil, the soil particles are very small. The small particles stick together closely. A clay soil is the smallest particle size that can still be called soil.
In a loam soil, the soil particles are medium-sized. Because the particles are larger in a loam soil than in a clay soil, loam soil has more space between particles than clay soil does.
In a sand soil, the soil particles are large. The particles in a sand soil stick together loosely. There is lots of space between the particles in a sand soil.
In a gravel soil, the particles are very large. These particles are so large that they are not in the soil type. Instead, they make up a water or land ecosystem.

An Everglades National Park ecosystem is better described as having land that is covered in water during most of the year. It also has other water ecosystems nearby.

What type of rock is shale?,"sedimentary
igneous",0,0,sedimentary,"Answer: A
Explanation: Shale is a type of sedimentary rock. It forms when layers of mud are pressed together to form rock.
Sedimentary rocks often contain fossils. A fossil is the remaining part, or impression, of an ancient organism. This fossil may be very old. Over many years, sedimentary rocks can form on top of fossils. So, scientists can study the fossilized remains of an organism in a layer of sedimentary rock and learn about the organism.
Igneous rocks form when hot liquid, called magma, cools and hardens into rock. Volcanoes release some igneous rocks. Other igneous rocks form deep below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rocks form when a rock changes. Rocks can change when they are under great pressure deep below Earth's surface. Or rocks can change when rocks are heated deep below Earth's surface. This change creates a different rock, but it is still made of the same types of minerals.

Did you know that there are more than 200 different types of rock? Most rock is made of one or more minerals. Minerals in a type of rock are usually not arranged in a pattern.","Shale is a type of sedimentary rock. It forms when layers of mud are pressed together to form rock.

"Complete the text to describe the diagram.
Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.","to the left than to the right
to the right than to the left",0,1,to the right than to the left,"Answer: B
Explanation: In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane to the right than to the left. When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
In your saltwater solution, you may have noticed that the salt particles move on their own. This movement is called diffusion. During diffusion, solute particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. Areas of high concentration have more solute particles. Areas of low concentration have fewer solute particles.
As the solute moves, it diffuses through the solvent. The solute does not separate from the solvent until the concentration is the same on all parts of the solution. At that point, the solute has reached equilibrium in the solution.
Temperature can affect the rate of diffusion. As temperature increases, diffusion usually occurs more quickly.","In this situation, the solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane.

Temperature can affect the rate of diffusion. As temperature increases, diffusion usually occurs more quickly.","Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.",0.4158217372234363,0.08629782284348675,0.4553571378587372,0.3235294117647059

Heteropoda altmannae",0,0,Heteropoda davidbowie,"Answer: A
Explanation: Heteropoda davidbowie is this huntsman spider's scientific name. New species are still being discovered, and scientists continue to describe and name these new species.

A species, or type of organism, is described scientifically using a binomial name. Binomial names have two parts:
The first part identifies the genus, or large group, to which the organism belongs.
The second part identifies one specific member of that genus.
Together, these parts form the organism's species name.","Heteropoda davidbowie is this huntsman spider's scientific name. New species are still being discovered, and scientists continue to describe and name these new species.

The word davidbowie refers to David Bowie. So, this huntsman spider's scientific name is Heteropoda davidbowie.

When a scientist identifies a new organism, he or she chooses its scientific name.
Sometimes, an organism is named after the place where it was first found. Other times, an organism is named after the scientist who first identified it. Or, the scientific name might describe the organism's physical traits.
Many of the words that make up scientific names are based on words from old languages, like Latin and classical Greek.

Which of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?,"the watering method used
the change in weight for each plant",1,1,the change in weight for each plant,"Answer: B
Explanation: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring.

Which of these continents does the prime meridian intersect?,"Africa
Australia
Asia",0,0,Africa,"Answer: A
Explanation: The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or Asia.

The lines on a map that show latitude and longitude help people find places. These lines are imaginary lines drawn on maps and Earth. The lines of latitude are called circles. Imagine drawing a circle around Earth. This circle would be a line of latitude. There is a special line of latitude called the equator. It shows the line around Earth where the northern and southern halves are the same size. Latitude is measured by lines of latitude. These lines are measured in degrees (°). The equator is 0° latitude. The lines of latitude get larger as you move away from the equator.","The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa.

It does not intersect Australia or Asia.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",0.1996385805861183,0.08659371415261653,0.44444443963065566,0.38636363636363635
"Is a ruler a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a liquid
a gas
a solid",2,2,a solid,"C
Explanation: A ruler is a solid because it has a definite shape and size. 

Solid, Liquid, and Gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite shape and a definite size. So, a solid has a length, a width, and a height.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Other solids are hard to fold, bend, or break. A rock is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite size, but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a length and a width, but it does not have a height. A liquid can be poured into a different container. It will still take up the same amount of space.
All liquids have the same properties. A liquid takes the shape of its container. It also takes up the same amount of space as the container.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite shape or a definite size. So, a gas can have different lengths, widths, and heights. Gas takes up the space in whatever container it is in.","A ruler is a solid because it has a definite shape and size.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.0002535536084647354,6.534635614620683e-05,0.16417910144241485,0.075

"In this food web, which organism contains matter that eventually moves to the sea cucumber?","bat star
phytoplankton
kelp bass",1,1,phytoplankton,"Answer: B
Explanation: Look at the arrow starting from the sea cucumber. It points to the plainfin midshipman. This arrow represents which organism contains matter that another organism eats. So, the matter in the sea cucumber moves to the plainfin midshipman.

A food web models how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem. Organisms in an ecosystem are connected because they eat each other. An arrow in a food web points from the organism that is eaten to the organism that eats it.
For example, in the food web above, there is an arrow from the phytoplankton to the plainfin midshipman. This represents that the plainfin midshipman eats the phytoplankton.","Look at the arrow starting from the sea cucumber. It points to the plainfin midshipman.

For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the sea cucumber.There is one path matter can take from the kelp to the sea cucumber: kelp->sea urchin->sea otter->orca->sea cucumber. kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp bass to the sea cucumber.. bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bat star to the sea cucumber.. There are two paths matter can take from the phytoplankton to the sea cucumber: phytoplankton->plainfin midshipman->sea cucumber. phytoplankton->zooplankton->plainfin midshipman->sea cucumber.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.09739081130111381,0.02937465003439885,0.429447848415823,0.32558139534883723
Which trait did Holophagus have? Select the trait you can observe on the fossil.,"a tail fin
a large red lump on its head
long legs",0,0,a tail fin,"Answer: A
Explanation: A tail fin is a type of fin that is located at the tail of an animal. It is shown on the fossil provided.
Holophagus had other traits as well. It had a large red lump on its head and long legs.

A fossil is the preserved evidence of an organism from the past. Fossils can consist of entire organisms, parts of organisms, or tracks and other signs of an organism's activity. The preserved evidence can be very detailed, allowing scientists to determine the structure of the organism. Some fossils even preserve microorganisms, or microscopic organisms. Most fossils form when the parts of an organism are deposited with sediment. Over time, the sediment hardens into rock. The rock preserves the fossil. After a fossil forms, it usually moves from the place where it was formed. For example, a fossil might be lifted by tectonic plate motion to a mountain top. Or water or wind might move a fossil.","A tail fin is a type of fin that is located at the tail of an animal. It is shown on the fossil provided.

Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.
An organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved.",0.3551846075123148,0.0198080338937662,0.31088082402212147,0.2727272727272727

Which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles?,"Solution A
neither; their concentrations are the same
Solution B",0,0,Solution A,"Answer: A
Explanation: The more concentrated a solution is, the higher its concentration of particles is. In a less concentrated solution, there are fewer particles of solute per solvent particle.
To compare the concentrations of the solutions, find which one has a higher concentration of purple particles.
Each purple particle in a solution is like a solute particle. Each solvent particle is like a water molecule.
The solution with the higher concentration of purple particles has more purple particles per solvent particle.

Use the label on each jar to find the number of solute particles in each solution.
Solution A has 10 solute particles, and Solution B has 6 solute particles.
Each jar contains 40 solvent particles. So, Solution A has more solute particles per solvent particle than Solution B does. Therefore, Solution A is more concentrated than Solution B.","The more concentrated a solution is, the higher its concentration of particles is.

Each jar contains 40 solvent particles. So, Solution A has more solute particles per solvent particle than Solution B does. Therefore, Solution A is more concentrated than Solution B.","In Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.42058704320959145,0.16092771663577418,0.46043164981315665,0.3333333333333333

It has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is poor in nutrients.",0,0,It has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is rich in nutrients.,"Answer: A
Explanation: A tide pool ecosystem has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is rich in nutrients.

The organisms in a tide pool ecosystem get energy from different sources. Some of the organisms get their food by eating other organisms. These organisms are consumers. Other organisms in this ecosystem make their own food. These organisms are producers.
The water in a tide pool can flood and drain several times a day. When the water floods the tide pool, it brings in new organisms and new nutrients. When the water drains, some organisms leave with the water. Some organisms stay in the tide pool when the water drains.
Organisms in an ecosystem are connected to each other in food chains and food webs. A food chain shows how matter and energy travel from organism to organism. Food webs show who eats whom in an ecosystem.","A tide pool ecosystem has daily flooding and draining of seawater. It also has water that is rich in nutrients.

"Is the air from a hair dryer a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a gas
a solid
a liquid",0,0,a gas,"Answer: A
Explanation: The air from a hair dryer is a gas. It has no set shape or volume. It takes the shape and volume of the space it is in.

There are three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.

In a solid, the particles are closely locked in place. The matter takes the shape of a solid because the particles can only move slightly in place.
In a liquid, the particles can move past one another. The matter takes the shape of a container. But the particles are closely locked, so the liquid will not expand beyond the container's size.
In a gas, the particles are closely locked. The gas will expand to fill a space.","The air from a hair dryer is a gas. It has no set shape or volume. It takes the shape and volume of the space it is in.

In a liquid, the particles can move past one another. The matter takes the shape of a container. But the particles are closely locked, so the liquid will not expand beyond the container's size.
In a gas, the particles are closely locked. The gas will expand to fill a space.","The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.1582016648752945,0.0486623368201002,0.3699421920745765,0.25

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"neither; the samples have the same temperature
sample B
sample A",2,2,sample A,"Answer: C
Explanation: The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy. Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

The figure shows two pure substances in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one particle in the substance.","The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance.

"Is a T-shirt a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a liquid

A T-shirt is a solid because the molecules that make up the T-shirt have a definite shape and size.","a solid

A T-shirt is a solid because the molecules that make up the T-shirt have a definite shape and size.","A T-shirt is a solid. You can fold a T-shirt. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",1.746136458521616e-05,5.2901136868545295e-06,0.19672130919645262,0.07692307692307693

Explanation: The European nightjar has a short, thin beak. It is adapted to catch insects by snapping them up quickly.
Birds have different body structures that allow them to eat different types of food.","The European nightjar has a short, thin beak. It is adapted to catch insects by snapping them up quickly.
Birds have different body structures that allow them to eat different types of food.","Look at the picture of the European nightjar.

Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The sand martin has a short, thin beak. Its beak is adapted to catch insects.
The hanging parrot has a small hooked beak. Its beak is not adapted to catch insects. The hanging parrot uses its beak to eat fruit and seeds.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.",0.012383639618432129,0.004847068790445021,0.32258064149323623,0.2

A compound is made from two or more elements that are chemically combined. Carbon dioxide is a compound made from carbon and oxygen elements.","Use the model to determine whether iodine is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the ball-and-stick model shown above, both of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that dark purple represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol I. So, the model shows you that a molecule of iodine is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that iodine is composed of only one chemical element. So, iodine is an elementary substance.

There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

neither; their concentrations are the same",2,0,Solution A,"A. Solution A

The number of solute particles is greater in solution a than in solution b. The solvent in both solutions is the same amount, so the solution with more solute particles has the higher concentration.","Solution A

The number of solute particles is greater in solution a than in solution b. The solvent in both solutions is the same amount, so the solution with more solute particles has the higher concentration.","In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of pink particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Is an arrowhead a solid or a liquid?,"a solid
a liquid",0,0,a solid,"A

Answer: A
Explanation: An arrowhead is a solid. A solid has an size and shape of its own. An arrowhead keeps its shape, even when you stop holding it.

Solid and liquid are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.

The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",2,2,The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.,"Answer: C
Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart.
Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.

Which animal's skin is better adapted as a warning sign to ward off predators?,"lichen katydid
sharpnose-puffer",1,1,sharpnose-puffer,"Answer: B
Explanation: The 's skin is adapted to ward off predators. It has poisonous glands.
Poisonous animals often have colorations or patterns on their bodies. These colorations and patterns are often adapted to help the animal in a specific way.
Camouflage is a coloration or pattern that allows a species to hide from predators. For example, a tiger's striped pattern helps it hide among grasses when hunting.
Warning signals are colorations or patterns on a species that warn predators of a specific reason why they should not attack the species. For example, a red and yellow striped pattern on an insect may warn predators that the insect is toxic.

An animal's features, including its skin, are adapted to suit its environment. An adaptation is a characteristic of an organism that helps it survive in its environment. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
If a characteristic helps an organism survive in its environment, then the characteristic is an adaptive feature for that environment. Different environments might require different adaptive features. Jawbones are an adaptive feature for fish. A fish's jawbones help it eat small organisms that float in the water.","The 's skin is adapted to ward off predators. It has poisonous glands.

The sharpnose-puffer has a poisonous body with brightly colored skin. Its skin is adapted to ward off predators.
The lichen katydid has green and white patches on its body. Its skin is not adapted to be a warning sign that wards off predators.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm.

"In this food chain, the katydid is a primary consumer. Why?","It eats a primary consumer.
It makes its own food.
It eats a producer.",2,2,It eats a producer.,"Answer: C
Explanation: Producers make their own food. They are primary consumers' food source.
Primary consumers eat producers. They get their food from eating other organisms.
Secondary consumers eat primary consumers. They get their food from eating other organisms.
Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. They get their food from eating other organisms.
The red fox is a tertiary consumer because it eats a secondary consumer.
The deer mouse is a primary consumer because it eats a producer.
The katydid is a primary consumer because it eats a producer.
The slender wheatgrass is a producer because it makes its own food through photosynthesis.

Organisms in an ecosystem are connected by food chains. Organisms are connected to the other organisms they eat and eat them. Each organism has a role in the food chain.

Secondary consumers eat primary consumers.
Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers.","In this food chain, the katydid is a primary consumer because it eats a producer. The producer in this food chain is the slender wheatgrass.

Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer.

Is plagioclase a mineral?,"no
yes",1,1,yes,"Answer: B
Explanation: Plagioclase is a mineral. It is one of the common minerals found in Earth's crust.

Minerals are pure substances that meet four conditions:
1. They are formed in nature.
2. They are solid.
3. They are not made by living things.
4. They have a fixed crystal structure.

So, plagioclase is a mineral because it is formed in nature, is solid, is not made by living things, and has a fixed crystal structure.

Example of a mineral: quartz
Examples of things that are not minerals: a drop of water, air, soil, and an appletör

Is eclogite a mineral?,"no
yes",0,1,yes,"Answer: B
Explanation: An eclogite is a rock, not a mineral. A rock is a type of solid material made up of one or more minerals or glass.

Rocks come in many colors and types. They can be light or dark. They can be smooth or bumpy. Rocks in one layer of the Earth can be very different from those in layers above or below.
Minerals and rocks both form solids that have a fixed volume and shape. So, they are both examples of solids called solids of constant shape. Both minerals and rocks are also pure substances and mixtures.
But there is an important difference between minerals and rocks!
A mineral has a fixed chemical composition. This means that no matter where a mineral forms, it will always have the same properties. For example, quartz is always made of silicon and oxygen. It is always hard and has a glassy appearance.
A rock does not have a fixed chemical composition. This is because a rock can be made of any combination of minerals. For example, granite is always made of quartz, feldspar, and mica. But a granite rock can still have other minerals besides these three.
So, is an eclogite a mineral or a rock?
An eclogite is a rock. It is not made of one solid material. It is made of two minerals: pyroxene and garnet. An eclogite can have other minerals too. So, an eclogite is not made of fixed combination of minerals. That means an eclogite is a rock, not a mineral.","An eclogite is a rock, not a mineral.

a liquid",1,1,a gas,"B

Explanation: Air is a gas. It will expand to fill a space. The balls in your soccer game are filled with gas.",Air is a gas. It will expand to fill a space. The balls in your soccer game are filled with gas.,"The air inside a soccer ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air fills all the space inside the soccer ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",1.19297862787469e-05,5.5880460478557205e-06,0.1954887193555317,0.07142857142857142

Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.

Select the organism in the same genus as the great egret.,"Ardea alba
Diodon nicthemerus
Tyto alba",0,0,Ardea alba,"Answer: A
Explanation: An organism's genus often includes many organisms that look similar to each other and share many of the same physical characteristics. Scientists have divided organisms into groups based on characteristics such as how their bodies are structured and what environmental niches they occupy. Organisms that belong to the same genus often look very similar to each other.
Scientists use genus names to identify organisms. For example, the genus name for the great egret is Ardea.
Every organism has a genus name and a species name when it is named scientifically. For example, the scientific name for the white pelican is Pelecanus erythrorhynchos. Pelecanus is the genus name, and erythrorhynchos is the species name.
Remember that organisms in the same genus can look very different. That's because the species name provides information about which organism is which.","An organism's genus often includes many organisms that look similar to each other and share many of the same physical characteristics. Scientists have divided organisms into groups based on characteristics such as how their bodies are structured and what environmental niches they occupy. Organisms that belong to the same genus often look very similar to each other.
Scientists use genus names to identify organisms. For example, the genus name for the great egret is Ardea.
Every organism has a genus name and a species name when it is named scientifically. For example, the scientific name for the white pelican is Pelecanus erythrorhynchos. Pelecanus is the genus name, and erythrorhynchos is the species name.
Remember that organisms in the same genus can look very different. That's because the species name provides information about which organism is which.","A great egret's scientific name is Ardea alba. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.
Tyto alba and Ardea alba are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Tyto alba and Ardea alba have the same species name within their genus, alba. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Tyto alba is in the genus Tyto, and Ardea alba is in the genus Ardea.
This organism and the great egret are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Ardea alba.
Diodon nicthemerus is in the genus Diodon. The first word of its scientific name is Diodon. So, Diodon nicthemerus and Ardea alba are not in the same genus.

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.",0.1746376546202099,0.031241423123311178,0.38787878289366395,0.3783783783783784

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.

Explanation: This passage describes Baja California in general terms. It does not describe the weather at any particular time.

Passages in science often describe two different ideas: weather and climate. Both ideas refer to patterns of atmospheric conditions. But they have different meanings.
When someone wants to know what to expect on their trip, they might ask about a place's climate. They are interested in long-term patterns of atmospheric conditions.
The image shows a desert. Deserts have little rainfall and clear skies for many years. So, scientists would say that deserts have a dry climate.
On some days, the sky over a desert might be cloudy. And it might even rain a little. But these clouds and rain are part of short-term weather, not the long-term climate.","This passage describes Baja California in general terms. It does not describe the weather at any particular time.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.
The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",2,2,The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.,"Answer: C
Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart.
Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 repel. The magnets in Pair 2 attract. But distance affects the strength of the magnetic force the same way for repelling magnets and for attracting magnets.
Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker. The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?,"sample B
sample A
neither; the samples have the same temperature",0,0,sample B,"Answer: A
Explanation: The particles in both samples have different masses, so their speeds and kinetic energies are relative to each other. The average speed of the particles in sample B is greater than the average speed of the particles in sample A. Sample B also has more mass than sample A. Therefore, the particles in sample B have a greater average kinetic energy than those in sample A.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample. So, the particles in sample B have a higher temperature than the particles in sample A.

This graphic shows that the particles in sample B are moving faster than those in sample A. It also shows that these particles have different masses. But remember, for this question, don't compare the masses of the particles in each sample. Compare their speeds, instead.","The particles in both samples have different masses, so their speeds and kinetic energies are relative to each other.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.

Which of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?,"the distance the footballs traveled
the air pressure in the footballs",0,0,the distance the footballs traveled,"Answer: A
Explanation: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring.

Select the chemical formula for this molecule.,"H3S2
He2S2
H2S
H2SN",2,2,H2S,"Answer: C
Explanation: A compound is a substance made up of two or more different atoms bonded together. The atoms in a compound are usually held together by electrical forces. The chemical formula of a compound can be written using its element symbols and subscripts to show the types and numbers of atoms. For example, the compound shown can be written as H2S.

A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that can exist by itself. Molecules can be made of either one type of atom or different types of atoms. The molecule shown can be written as H2S because it is made of two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom.","A compound is a substance made up of two or more different atoms bonded together.

A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that can exist by itself. Molecules can be made of either one type of atom or different types of atoms. The molecule shown can be written as H2S because it is made of two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom.","H is the symbol for hydrogen. S is the symbol for sulfur. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and S. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There is one sulfur atom, so S will not have a subscript.
The correct formula is H2 S.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.",0.057291441042122485,0.013335062752693598,0.41237112978796897,0.2786885245901639

Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry",0,0,if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use,"Answer: A
Explanation: People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The steps of this process are commonly described using the acronym PDCA, where P stands for plan, D stands for do, C stands for check, and A stands for act.
When engineers test a solution, they might:
- Use measurements to collect data
- Perform multiple trials
The slump test described in the passage is an example of a test that engineers use to test a potential solution.
Engineers may test a variety of solutions before finding one that works best within the constraints. For instance, a slump test might be used to test a potential batch of concrete. The engineers who designed the test might check different numbers of trials to find out if a certain number of trials gives consistent results. Or the engineers might change the way the test is performed to see if that affects the results of the test.

Test results are used to determine whether a solution meets the requirements of the design. If a solution does not work as intended, engineers will use the test results to improve the design before testing again. Working to make a design work within the required constraints is called optimizing the design.","People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.
Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.35680751173708924,0.10572192514924841,0.2952380902544218,0.3488372093023256

Explanation: Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.","Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.",0,2,The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.,"Answer: C
Explanation: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the strength of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.
This means that the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.

Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.
Fossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.
Here are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:
This is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.
This is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.
This is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.

"Based on the arrows, which of the following organisms is a decomposer?","earthworm
bilberry",0,0,earthworm,"Answer: A
Explanation: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this ecosystem. For each arrow, the beginning organism gets its matter from the organism it is pointing to.
An earthworm is a decomposer. It gets its matter from lichen and mushroom.
A bilberry is a producer. It can make its own matter through photosynthesis.
A collared lemming is a consumer. It gets its matter by eating producers or consumers.
A barren-ground caribou is a consumer. It gets its matter by eating producers or consumers.
A grizzly bear is a consumer. It gets its matter by eating producers or consumers.

A producer makes its own matter. It makes its own food using the energy from the sun.
The sun gives light to the earth. Plants use this light to make their own matter through photosynthesis.
Producers often form the base of a food web. Many consumers are producers.
A decomposer breaks down matter from dead organisms. It gets its matter from consumers and other decomposers.
Decomposers return matter to the earth. This matter can then be used by producers to make their own matter.

These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The earthworm does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the earthworm is a decomposer.
The bilberry has arrows pointing from it. So, the bilberry is not a decomposer.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.",0.25105817481754533,0.02752054809936367,0.41530054148168055,0.3333333333333333

The giant pangolin has hard scales covering much of its body. It is adapted to defend its body against a predator with sharp teeth. The giant pangolin can roll into a ball to protect the soft parts of its body.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The nine-banded armadillo has hard plates under its tough, leathery skin. It is adapted to defend its body against a predator with sharp teeth.
The Grant's gazelle has thin, hair-covered skin. It is not adapted to defend its body against a predator with sharp teeth.

Animals' adaptations help them use their resources and survive. Adaptations can help an animal in different ways. For example, an adaptation may help an animal get food or avoid predation. An animal's adaptations are also related to its environment. The same type of adaptation can help different animals in different ways.","Look at the picture of the giant pangolin.

When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

Explanation: The equator passes through the middle of Africa. It cuts through no other continent.",The equator passes through the middle of Africa. It cuts through no other continent.,"The equator is the line at 0° latitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or Europe.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",8.086966493454933e-09,8.920648161170276e-10,0.10434782408166354,0.022727272727272728

"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Saturn's volume is more than 50% of Jupiter's volume.","false
true",1,1,true,"Answer: B.
Explanation: Use the information in the table to compare the volumes of Saturn and Jupiter.
Find the volume of Saturn.
50% of 1,431,280 is close to 700,000. So, 50% of Jupiter's volume is about the same as Saturn's volume. This means Saturn's volume is less than 50% of Jupiter's volume.

Read the numbers in the table. Remember that percentages go from 0 to 100.
To find the volume of Saturn is what percent of the volume of Jupiter, divide the volume of Saturn by the volume of Jupiter, then multiply by 100.
787,130 ÷ 1,431,280 × 100 = 55.266...
So, Saturn's volume is about 55.27%, or about 50%, of Jupiter's volume. This means Saturn's volume is more than 50% of Jupiter's volume.

So, Saturn's volume is about 55.27%, or about 50%, of Jupiter's volume. This means Saturn's volume is more than 50% of Jupiter's volume.

Numbers can be written in words or as decimals.
A decimal is written with a decimal point.
The digits after the decimal point name the part of one whole.","To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 50% of Jupiter's volume by multiplying Jupiter's volume by 0.5.
Then compare the result to the volume of Saturn. The volume of Saturn is 827,130 billion km^3, which is more than 715,640 billion km^3. So, Saturn's volume is more than 50% of Jupiter's volume.

A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.",0.3266666666666667,0.1311963365452618,0.29007633098304303,0.16666666666666666

It does not intersect South America or Africa.","The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Asia or South America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Which of the following could Colette and Alexandra's test show?,"if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry",0,0,if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use,"Answer: A
Explanation: People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The results of tests can show whether a problem has been solved sufficiently or how close a solution is to working.
When a potential solution is tested, one type of test shows if a component meets the requirements of the design. Such a test needs to be done carefully so the results show if the problem has been solved sufficiently.
The graph shows that the test revealed whether each batch of concrete was firm enough to use. The test is repeated for different batches to show which batches are firm enough to use.
On the other hand, the test does not show how the concrete from each batch compares to one another. The test also does not show if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry.","People can use the engineering-design process to test if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.

It has a small amount of rain. It also has only a few types of organisms.",0,1,It has a small amount of rain. It also has only a few types of organisms.,"Answer: B
Explanation: A biotic factor is an living part of an ecosystem. Biotic factors include plants, animals, and other organisms that affect an organism.
The amount of rain that falls each year is a big factor in any ecosystem. Water is important for growing plants. Many animals also need water to stay alive. A place's animals are better adapted to living there when there is enough water for them.
Thin soil is not as good as thick soil for growing plants. So, thin soil is a factor that affects the plants in an ecosystem. Soil can be thick or thin.厚土通常含有大量的有机物质。It depends on how much organic material the soil contains.
Organisms in an ecosystem are adapted in different ways. The adaptations can help or hinder interaction with biotic and abiotic factors in the ecosystem.
Use the term biotic factor for living parts of an ecosystem. Use the term abiotic factor for nonliving parts of an ecosystem.
Water is a abiotic factor that affects an organism's adaptation. Organisms are adapted in different ways for obtaining and depending on water.
Plants usually need more water than animals do. Plants are usually adapted to get and hold more water than animals are. Do mosses have adaptations that help them get and hold water, or are they adapted to live with less water? Thin soil is an abiotic factor. Soil can be thick or thin.厚土通常含有大量的有机物质。It depends on how much organic material the soil contains.
Mosses have thin soil is a factor that affects mosses. Mosses are adapted to live in thin soil. Thin soil is not as good as thick soil for growing plants. So, thin soil is a factor that affects the plants in a ecosystem.
Mosses have adaptations that help them get and hold water, such as leaves that look like hairs. These adaptations help mosses stay adapted to living in places with little water.","A biotic factor is an living part of an ecosystem.

Is slate a mineral?,"no
yes",0,0,no,"Answer: A
Explanation: Slate is not a mineral. Slate is a type of rock.
A mineral is a type of matter that is both a substance and a solid.
There are millions of different substances, but there are only six main types of minerals: silicates, carbonates, sulfides, nitrates, oxides, and sulfates.
Slate is not a mineral because it is not a solid. It is a type of rock.

Rocks are not minerals. Rocks are solids that have a specific composition. But the composition is not as important for rocks as it is for minerals. Rocks can have variable composition.","Slate is not a mineral. Slate is a type of rock.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.17334915554733002,0.03951295022172819,0.30136985851003945,0.17142857142857143

Is Nerium oleander made up of many cells?,"no
yes",1,1,yes,"Answer: B
Explanation: Nerium oleander is a plant. Like all plants, Nerium oleander is made up of many cells.
A cell is the smallest unit that can form a living organism. Organisms that are made up of multiple cells are called multicellular organisms. Plants, animals, fungi, and some single-celled organisms are multicellular organisms.
The size of a multicellular organism ranges from very small to very large. For example, a mushroom is small and is made up of only a few cells. Some tropical trees are very large and are made up of billions of cells. All multicellular organisms start as a single cell. This first cell divides into two cells. The two cells divide again. The cell division continues for many generations. The organism grows and develops parts that make it adapted to its function.

Use structural hierarchy to describe how organisms are organized into groups and categories.
Scientists use a structural hierarchy to describe how living things are organized. They can use the hierarchy to show relationships between living things. Living things that are in the same place in the hierarchy have more in common.
The structural hierarchy starts with the cell. A cell is the smallest unit that can form a living organism. An organism may be made of one type of cell or many different types of cells.
Organisms are members of one or more species. A species is a group of similar organisms. For example, leopards are in the species ""leopard."" All leopards are similar to each other, but they are different from lions, which are in a different species.
Organisms are also members of one or more kingdoms. A kingdom is a large group of similar species. All leopards are in the kingdom ""animal."" All animals are similar because they share characteristics that make them different from plants and fungi.
Groups within a kingdom may be called phyla (plural), phylum (singular), class, or order. For example, leopards are in the phylum ""vertebrate."" All vertebrates have a backbone.
Some groups have subgroups called families. For example, leopards are in the family ""cat."" All cats猎豹 are in the family ""cat,"" but they are different from dogs, which are in the family ""canine.""

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.",0,0,The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.,"Answer: A
Explanation: The magnets in Pair 1 have their opposite poles facing each other. The magnets in Pair 2 have their like poles facing each other. Recall that magnets can either attract or repel. Attraction happens between two opposite poles. Repulsion happens between two like poles. The magnetic force is weaker in the longer pair because the distance between the opposite poles is greater.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is the strength of the pull or push.
Think about what happens to the pull or push when you increase the distance between two magnets, like in Pair 2. The magnetic force between them gets weaker. Now think about what happens to the pull or push when you decrease the distance between two magnets, like in Pair 1. The magnetic force between them gets stronger.","The magnets in Pair 1 have their opposite poles facing each other. The magnets in Pair 2 have their like poles facing each other.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

"Is an icicle a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a solid
a liquid
a gas",0,0,a solid,"Answer: A
Explanation: An icicle is a solid. When water freezes, it becomes a solid.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.","An icicle is a solid. When water freezes, it becomes a solid.

Which animal is also adapted to be camouflaged among green leaves?,"blue poison dart frog
shield mantis",1,1,shield mantis,"Answer: B
Explanation: Look at the picture of the leaf-mimic katydid.
The leaf-mimic katydid is adapted to be camouflaged among green leaves. It is the same color as the leaves around it.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal is adapted in the same way.
The blue poison dart frog is bright blue with bright yellow spots. It is not camouflaged among green leaves.
The shield mantis is green. It is camouflaged among green leaves.

An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.

Will these magnets attract or repel each other?,"repel
attract",0,1,attract,"Answer: B
Explanation: The magnets are attracting each other. When one magnet is held next to another magnet, there is a force between the two magnets. This force can cause the magnets to move toward or away from each other. If the opposite ends of two magnets are close to each other, the magnets will move away from each other. This is called repulsion. If the same end, or poles, of two magnets are close to each other, the magnets will move toward each other. This is called attraction.

Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet is attracted or repelled by another magnet depends on the positions of their poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel.","The magnets are attracting each other.

Examples of minerals are graphite and diamond. Both are made of carbon, but they are not the same mineral because their properties are different.","Candle wax does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, candle wax is not a mineral.

Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.",0.38514108016099313,0.1282555573891877,0.4370860881206965,0.3055555555555556
Which of the following could Harold's test show?,"if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50°C
how well the weather station would work when it was windy",0,0,if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50°C,"Answer: A
Explanation: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The conditions that a test is run in are called the independent variable. The change or result in the test are called the dependent variable.
When scientists want to test a potential solution thoroughly, they may run several tests. Each test has one independent variable that is changed to see its effect on the dependent variable.
Imagine that a group of scientists developed a new type of paint intended to reduce water use in households. They want to test their paint. So, they design a test where they will paint half of the outside of a house with their new paint and paint the other half with the current paint. Then, they will measure how much water is used to wash each half of the house over the next year.
In the test, the independent variable is the type of paint. The type of paint is changed to see its effect on the dependent variable, which is the amount of water used to wash each half of the house.","People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems.

Imagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.
First, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.
Then, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.
Tests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",0.3939343357209401,0.18440704935537464,0.41489361203542324,0.32558139534883723

Which of the following was an independent variable in this experiment?,"the number of earthworms
the number of leaves",0,0,the number of earthworms,"Answer: A
Explanation: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring.

Solution B has more solute in the same amount of solvent as solution A. It has a higher concentration of blue particles.

To understand this concept better, think about a situation where you have two glasses of water. Both glasses contain the same amount of water. However, one glass has more salt dissolved in it than the other glass. The glass with more salt has a higher concentration of salt.","Solution B has more solute in the same amount of solvent as solution A. It has a higher concentration of blue particles.

To understand this concept better, think about a situation where you have two glasses of water. Both glasses contain the same amount of water. However, one glass has more salt dissolved in it than the other glass. The glass with more salt has a higher concentration of salt.","In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of blue particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same.

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent",0.08612223276771774,0.021158772337720476,0.3484848439439853,0.22580645161290322

Explanation: The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. The direction of the magnetic force is different in each pair.",The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. The direction of the magnetic force is different in each pair.,"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

Identify the question that Leon's experiment can best answer.,"Do more bacteria grow in liquid with cinnamon than in liquid without cinnamon?
Does temperature affect how much bacteria can grow in liquid?",0,0,Do more bacteria grow in liquid with cinnamon than in liquid without cinnamon?,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the information given about Leon's experiment.
Leon mixed bacteria into a nutrient-rich liquid where the bacteria could grow. He poured four ounces of the mixture into each of ten glass flasks. In five of the ten flasks, he also added one teaspoon of cinnamon. He allowed the bacteria in the flask to grow overnight in a 37°C room. Then, Leon used a microscope to count the number of bacteria in a small sample from each flask. He compared the amount of bacteria in the liquid with cinnamon to the amount of bacteria in the liquid without cinnamon.
Leon changed whether or not his flask had cinnamon in it. This let him compare the growth of bacteria in liquid with cinnamon to the growth of bacteria in liquid without cinnamon. So, Leon's experiment can best answer: Do more bacteria grow in liquid with cinnamon than in liquid without cinnamon?
Leon did not change the temperature of the liquid. So, he cannot use his experiment to answer: Does temperature affect how much bacteria can grow in liquid?

South America",0,0,Antarctica,"Answer: A
Explanation: The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Antarctica. It does not intersect North America or South America.

The Meridians and parallels are lines that help us to find places on the Earth's surface. They are like lines of latitude and lines of longitude on a map.
The Meridians are lines that run from the North Pole to the South Pole. They are also called lines of longitude.
The Parallels are lines that run parallel to the Equator. They are also called lines of latitude.","The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Antarctica. It does not intersect North America or South America.

Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Explanation: A trait is an observable characteristic of an organism. Meiolania, like other animals, has traits that help it to survive. You can see traits of Meiolania in its fossilized remains. For example, Meiolania has toes, which is a trait of this animal.

An organism's traits are important because they can affect whether or not the organism can survive in its environment.-envirnment
The environment of an organism consists of all the factors, both living and nonliving, that affect the organism. An organism's environment can influence which traits are beneficial for survival. For example, if the temperature in your environment often changes, it might be beneficial for you to have hair, which can help regulate your body temperature. If your environment always has plenty of food, you might not need to be especially good at finding food. However, if food is hard to find in your environment, you might have a higher chance of surviving if you are good at finding it.","A trait is an observable characteristic of an organism.

"In this food chain, the brown trout is a secondary consumer. Why?","It eats a secondary consumer.
It eats a primary consumer.
It eats a producer.",1,1,It eats a primary consumer.,"Answer: B
Explanation: A food chain starts with a producer and a primary consumer. Here is the food chain from the picture: diatom → midge larva → brown trout → great cormorant. The diatom is a primary producer. The midge larva is a primary consumer because it eats a producer. The brown trout is a secondary consumer because it eats a primary consumer.

Every year, humans add large amounts of fertilizer to fields. This year, there was a lot of rain right after the fertilizer was added to fields. How did the rain affect the amount of fertilizer that became part of the food chain in these fields?
Fewer nutrients became part of the food chain. Some of the fertilizer was washed away before it could break down.
More nutrients became part of the food chain. The rain helped the fertilizer break down into nutrients that can be used by plants.
The same amount of nutrients became part of the food chain. Fertilizer always breaks down into nutrients at the same rate, no matter the weather.
The same amount of nutrients became part of the food chain. Some of the fertilizer broke down, but some also remained in the soil","A food chain starts with a producer and a primary consumer.

Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!",0.3643110162275462,0.09237426904459468,0.33513513014229374,0.2894736842105263

It is a producer of all the positions that come after it.","Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bilberry.
No arrow points to the lichen. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the lichen.
No arrow points to the bear sedge. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the bear sedge.
There are two arrows pointing to the collared lemming. One arrow starts from the bear sedge, and the other arrow starts from the lichen. Neither the bear sedge nor the lichen has an arrow pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the collared lemming.

A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?,"The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.
The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.",2,0,The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.,"Answer: A
Explanation: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart.

Magnetic forces are weaker when the magnets are farther apart. The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnetic force between them is weaker. There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.","Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching.

What can a pine seed grow into?,"a female cone
a new plant
a male cone",1,1,a new plant,"Answer: B
Explanation: A pine seed can grow into a new plant. It does not grow into a female cone or a male cone.

Pine trees are conifers. Conifers disperse their seeds using wind and animals.","A pine seed can grow into a new plant. It does not grow into a female cone or a male cone.

Pine trees are conifers. Conifers disperse their seeds using wind and animals.","A seed can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow male and female cones. But a seed does not grow into a male cone or a female cone.

Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.",0.02959777826682039,0.012348176991070482,0.40816326122448987,0.3333333333333333

Sometimes, an organism is named after the place where it was first found. Other times, an organism is named after the scientist who first identified it. Or, the scientific name might describe the organism's physical traits.
Many of the words that make up scientific names are based on words from old languages, like Latin and classical Greek. Sometimes, English words are changed to make them sound more like Latin or Greek. The new words are then used in an organism's scientific name.",0.2929936305732484,0.045816013410984825,0.2953020084230441,0.14285714285714285

PARAGRAPH: Camilla glued lids onto 16 cardboard shoe boxes of equal size. She painted eight of the boxes black and eight of the boxes white. Camilla made a small hole in the side of each box and then stuck a thermometer partially into each hole so she could measure the temperatures inside the boxes. She placed the boxes in direct sunlight in her backyard. Two hours later, she measured the temperature inside each box. Camilla compared the average temperature inside the black boxes to the average temperature inside the white boxes.

A control group is the part of an experiment that serves as a comparison to the treatment group. The treatment group is the part of an experiment that is exposed to the independent variable. You can use the control group to measure the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. Often, the control group is the part of the experiment that does not receive treatment, but in some experiments, the control group receives a placebo (a substance with no active ingredients) instead of treatment. In both cases, the control group is used to measure the effect of the treatment group.
Sometimes, there is no control group in an experiment. An experiment that does not have a control group is an observational experiment. No comparison can be drawn between the treatment and non-treatment groups in such an experiment.
An experiment is designed to test a cause-and-effect relationship. To identify the variable whose effect is being tested, ask yourself which is the treatment and which is the response.","Look at the image and read the paragraph carefully.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.
Imagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.
First, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.
Then, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.
Experiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.

September",1,1,January,"Answer: B
Explanation: The length of the bar for a month shows the average precipitation in that month. The longest bars are in January and September. But the bar for September is shorter than the bar for January. January is the wettest month.

A bar graph is a way to compare numbers using bars of different lengths. The length of each bar shows how big each number is.
The x-axis has months labeled in order. The y-axis shows precipitation, in millimeters. Each square on the y-axis represents 5 millimeters of precipitation.
Find September on the x-axis. Then find the bar length for September on the y-axis. The length of the bar for September is 6 millimeters. So, on average, 6 millimeters of precipitation falls in September.","The length of the bar for a month shows the average precipitation in that month. The longest bars are in January and September.

Which of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?,"the number of bacteria in a drop of tea
the amount of time that the tea sat on the desk",0,0,the number of bacteria in a drop of tea,"Answer: A
Explanation: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.
In this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.
The amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.
The number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment.","Experiments have variables, or parts that change.

keratin protein . . . KRT13 gene",0,0,KRT13 gene . . . keratin protein,"Answer: A
Explanation: Genes are parts of cells that contain the instructions used to make proteins. Genes can be thought of as the blueprints for making proteins. Sometimes, genes are changed or altered. When this happens, the gene is said to be mutated.
Every gene comes from an organism's genome with a certain version of the gene. For example, the human genome has a gene for brown eye color and a gene for blue eye color. Both genes can code for blue eyes. But one gene is for brown eyes, and the other gene is for blue eyes. The version of a gene that is passed from a parent to a offspring is called an allele.
So, the mutation in the KRT13 gene affected the structure and function of the keratin protein.

An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.
An organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.",0.38461538461538464,0.15646544774686721,0.3586206848285375,0.44

"Is the helium in balloons a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a gas
a liquid
a solid",0,0,a gas,"Answer: A
Explanation: Helium is a gas that is used to fill balloons.

There are three states, or phases, of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.
In a solid, the particles are closely arranged with fixed shapes and sizes.
Like solids, liquids have a fixed shape. But unlike solids, liquids do not have a fixed size. Liquid particles can move past each other.
A gas has no fixed shape or size. Gas particles are able to move freely.
Gas is the state in which matter has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. The particles that make up a gas are close together but are able to move freely past each other. A gas will expand to fill a container of any size or shape.
Helium is a gas. When it is used to fill balloons, the helium expands to fill the balloons.

Think about a change in state. During a change in state, matter might change from a solid to a gas. During this change, the particles of the matter are able to move freely, like they are in a gas. But the particles still have fixed shapes and sizes, like they are in a solid. So, a solid gas is not possible.","Helium is a gas that is used to fill balloons.

The helium in balloons expands to fill all the space inside the balloons. If a balloon pops, the helium will expand to fill a much larger space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",0.36180757496059485,0.05301315716244218,0.4019607793829297,0.25

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger.",0.38949557114604016,0.37594615252103886,0.8030302981955922,0.6785714285714286

"Is chocolate syrup a solid, a liquid, or a gas?","a gas
a liquid
a solid",1,1,a liquid,"B. a liquid

A liquid is a state of matter that has a fixed volume but takes the shape of its container. Liquid water takes the shape of its container, like the glass shown. 

Syrup is a type of liquid called a solution. It is made by mixing one or more substances called solutes with a substance called a solvent. In most solutions, the solvent is a liquid, such as water. In these cases, the solvent is usually listed first. That is why we usually think of water as the solvent even though it is a liquid. Chocolate syrup is a solution in which water is the solvent.","a liquid

Chocolate syrup is a solution in which water is the solvent.","Chocolate syrup is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.",0.12749423785698774,0.031595563594936295,0.2690058433637701,0.21052631578947367

What is the direction of this push?,"away from the bulldozer
toward the bulldozer",0,0,away from the bulldozer,"Answer: A
Explanation: Look at the bulldozer and the pile of dirt.
The bulldozer clears a path for a new road. A force from the bulldozer pushes loose dirt out of the way. So, the force from the bulldozer is away from the bulldozer.

A force can make an object start moving or stop moving, or change direction. Forces can also change the shape of an object.","Look at the bulldozer and the pile of dirt.
